<H2>Abstract</H2>
Group size is a function of relative neocortical volume in
nonhuman primates. Extrapolation from this regression equation yields a
predicted group size for modern humans very similar to that of certain
hunter-gatherer and traditional horticulturalist societies. Groups of
similar size are also found in other large-scale forms of contemporary
and historical society. Among primates, the cohesion of groups is
maintained by social grooming; the time devoted to social grooming is
linearly related to group size among the Old World monkeys and apes. To
maintain the stability  of the large groups characteristic of humans by
grooming alone would place intolerable demands on time budgets. It is
suggested that (1) the evolution of large groups in the human lineage
depended on the development of a more efficient method for time-sharing
the processes of social bonding and that (2) language uniquely fulfills
this requirement. Data on the size of conversational and other small
interacting groups of humans are in line with the predictions for the
relative efficiency of conversation compared to grooming as a bonding
process. Analysis of a sample of human conversations shows that about
60% of time is spent gossiping about relationships and personal
experiences. It is suggested that language evolved to allow individuals
to learn about the behavioural characteristics of other group members
more rapidly than is possible by direct observation alone.

1. Introduction
<P>
<P>Primates are, above all, social animals. This has inevitably
led to the suggestion that such intense sociality is functionally
related to the exceptional cognitive abilities of these animals,
as reflected in their unusually large brains (Jolly 1969,
Humphrey 1976, Kummer 1982, Byrne &amp; Whiten 1988). This claim is
supported by the finding that mean group size is directly related
to relative neocortical volume in nonhuman primates (Sawaguchi
&amp; Kudo 1990, Dunbar 1992a). These analyses suggest that although
the size of the group in which animals live in a given habitat
is a function of habitat-specific ecologically-determined costs
and benefits (see for example Dunbar 1988, 1992b), there is a
species-specific upper limit to group size which is set by purely
cognitive constraints: animals cannot maintain the cohesion and
integrity of groups larger than a size set by the information-
processing capacity of their neocortex.
<P>The group size identified by this relationship appears to
refer to the maximum number of individuals with whom an animal
can maintain social relationships by personal contact. It is not
necessary that all these individuals live in the same physical
group: chimpanzees (among a number of other species) have a
fission/fusion form of social system in which at any one time the
community (the group in the sense defined above) is divided into
a number temporary foraging parties whose composition changes 
repeatedly (see for example Wrangham 1986). Nor does it follow
that a species' social system consists only of a single type of
group:  it is now clear that most primate species live in complex
multi-tiered social systems in which different layers are
functional responses to different environmental problems (e.g.
the gelada and hamadryas baboons: see Dunbar 1988, 1989a). 
Rather, the neocortical constraint seems to be on the number of
relationships that an animal can keep track of in a complex,
continuously changing social world: the function subserved by
that level of grouping will depend on the individual species'
ecological and social context. 
<P>It is important to appreciate that the causal relationship
between group size and neocortex size depends on the explanatory
perspective (or level) adopted. In evolutionary terms, the size
of a species' neocortex is set by the range of group size
required by the habitat(s) in which it typically lives. However,
seen in proximate terms from an individual animal's point of
view, current neocortex size sets a limit on the number of
relationships that it can maintain through time, and hence limits
the maximum size of its group. This means that although the
evolution of neocortex size is driven by the ecological factors
that select for group size, we can use the relationship in
reverse to predict group sizes for living species (Dunbar 1992a).
<P>It is generally accepted that the cohesion of primate groups
is maintained through time by social grooming (see Dunbar 1988). 
Social grooming is used both to establish and to service those
friendships and coalitions that give primate groups their unique
structure. As might be anticipated, the amount of time devoted
to social grooming correlates well with group size, notably among
the catarrhine primates (Old World monkeys and apes) (Dunbar
1991). 
<P>However, the relationship between group size and time
devoted to grooming appears to be a consequence of the intensity
with which a small number of key "friendships" (the primary
network) is serviced rather than to the total number of
individuals in the group (Dunbar 1991; Kudo et al, in
preparation). These primary networks function as coalitions
whose primary purpose is to buffer their members against
harassment by the other members of the group. The larger the
group, the more harassment and stress an individual faces (see
for example Dunbar 1988) and the more important those coalitions
are. It seems that a coalition's effectiveness (in the sense of
its members' willingness to come to each other's aid) is directly
related to the amount of time its members spend grooming each
other (see Cheney &amp; Seyfarth 1984, Dunbar 1984). Hence, the
larger the group, the more time individuals devote to grooming
with the members of their coalitionary clique.   
<P>The mean size of the primary network is, however, related
to the mean group size for the species. This suggests that groups
are built up by welding together sets of smaller primary networks
(see also Cheney 1992) and that the total size of the group is
ultimately limited not by the number of networks that can be
welded together but rather by the size of the networks
themselves.
<P>In this paper, I ask what implications these two sets of
results have for modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens). If we
extrapolate from the nonhuman primate regression, what group size
would we predict for anatomically modern humans, given our
current neocortex size?  I then ask whether there are any
observed human group sizes that correspond to this predicted
value. Since the relationships that maintain group cohesion
among nonhuman primates are serviced by social grooming, I use
the regression equation for primates to determine how much time
humans would have to spend grooming each other if they were to
maintain group cohesion in this way for groups of the size
predicted from neocortex size. Finally, I ask what implications
this might have had for the evolution of language.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>2. Methods
<P>
<P>A number of different measures have been used in comparative
analyses to provide unbiased estimates of relative differences
in brain size. These have included the Extra Cortical Neurons
Index (the ratio of the observed number of cortical neurons over
and above those required for somatic maintenance, as estimated
from body size, brain size and neural density: Jerison 1973), the
cerebral Progression Index (the ratio of observed brain or
neocortical volume to that predicted for a basal Insectivore of
the same body size: Stephan 1972), the Encephalisation Quotient
(the residual of brain volume, or neocortex volume, regressed
against body weight: Jerison 1973, Clutton-Brock &amp; Harvey 1980,
Sawaguchi &amp; Kudo 1990) and the Neocortex Ratio (neocortex volume
divided by the volume of the rest of the brain or the volume of
the hindbrain: Dunbar 1992a). 
<P>In examining the relationship between neocortex size and
group size in nonhuman primates, I found that all these measures
are reasonable predictors of group size. However, Neocortex
Ratio (measured against the rest of the brain excluding the
neocortex) gives much the best fit, accounting for 76% of the
variance in mean group size among 36 genera of Prosimian and
Anthropoid primates (using data on neocortex volume provided by
Stephan et al 1981) (see Dunbar 1992a).
<P>This analysis was based on the mean group size observed for
a given genus rather than the maximum group size. The main
justification for using the mean group size in these analyses
lies in the nature of primate social groups. In contrast to the
relatively simple aggregations typical of many birds and
herbivores, primate groups are highly structured with individual
animals embedded in a complex set of social and kinship networks
(see Dunbar 1988, 1989a). Whereas bird flocks can shed
individuals through trickle migration as soon as they exceed
their optimal size, primate groups cannot:  they have to wait
until the group is large enough to permit it to fission into two
or more daughter groups of a minimum size necessary to ensure the
safety and survival of their members. This means that primate
groups tend to oscillate in size over quite a wide range around
the optimal value. At the point of fission (by definition, their
maximum observed size), groups tend to be unstable and close to
social disintegration: this, of course, is why they undergo
fission at that point. Hence, maximum group size is likely to
represent the point of complete social collapse rather than the
maximum size of group that the animals can maintain as a cohesive
social unit. Consequently, mean group size is likely to be a
better estimate of the limiting group size for a species than the
maximum ever observed in any population (for further discussion,
see Dunbar 1992a).
<P>

<P>
<P>3. Results
<P>
3.1. Group Size in Modern Humans
<P>The best-fit reduced major axis regression equation between
neocortex ratio and mean group size for the sample of 36 primate
genera shown in Fig.1 was found to be:
<P>log(N)  =  0.093 + 3.389 log(CR)             (1)
(r2=0.764, t34=10.35, p&lt;0.001), where N is the mean group size
and CR is the ratio of neocortex volume to the volume of the rest
of the brain (i.e. total brain volume minus neocortex) (Dunbar
1992a). Use of both major axis and least-squares regression, as
well as alternative indices of relative neocortex size, all yield
equations that are of about this same magnitude.
<P>With a neocortex volume of 1006.5 cc and a total brain
volume of 1251.8 cc (Stephan et al 1981), the neocortex ratio for
humans is CR=4.1. This is about 50% larger than the maximum
value for any other primate species (see Dunbar 1992a). Strictly
speaking, of course, extrapolation from regression equations
beyond the range of the X-variable values on which they are based
is frowned on. However, we can justify doing so in this case on
the grounds that our concern at this stage is exploratory rather
than explanatory. We do so, therefore, in the knowledge that the
confidence limits around any predictions are likely to be wide.
<P>Equation (1) yields a predicted group size for humans of
147.8. Because the equation is log-transformed and we are
extrapolating well beyond the range of neocortex ratios on which
it is based, the 95% confidence limits around this prediction
(from formulae given by Rayner 1985) are moderately wide (100.2-
231.1). Equations based on alternative indices of neocortex size
(see Dunbar 1992a, Table 2) yield predicted group sizes that
range from 107.6 (EQ residual of neocortex volume regressed
against body weight) to 189.1 (Jerison's Extra Neocortical
Neurons index) and 248.6 (absolute neocortex volume), all of
which are within (or close to) the 95% confidence limits on the
neocortex ratio equation.
<P>In trying to test this prediction, we encounter two
problems. One is deciding just what counts as the "natural"
condition for H. s. sapiens; the other is the problem of defining
the appropriate level of grouping for human societies living
under these conditions. 
<P>It is generally accepted that human cultural evolution has
proceeded at a very much faster pace than our anatomical 
evolution during the past few millenia. Given that our brain
size has its origins in the later stages of human evolution some
250,000 years ago (Martin 1983, Aiello &amp; Dean 1990), we may
assume that our current brain size reflects the kinds of groups
then prevalent and not those now found among technologically
advanced cultures. The closest we can get to this is to examine
those modern humans whose way of life is thought to be most
similar to that of our late Pleistocene ancestors. These are
generally presumed to be the hunter-gatherers (Service 1962,
Sahlins 1972). 
<P>Given that hunter-gatherers are the only appropriate source
of information, we then face the problem of deciding what
constitutes the appropriate level of grouping within hunter-
gatherer societies. There has, however, been considerable debate
within anthropology as to the precise structure of these
societies (see Service 1962, Birdsell 1970, Williams 1974, Morris
1982, Lee 1982). Irrespective of how this debate is eventually
resolved, it is nonetheless clear that most hunter-gatherers live
in complexly structured social universes that involve several
different levels of grouping.
<P>Thus, the !Kung San of southern Africa live in camps whose
composition can change from day to day, but whose membership is
mostly drawn from a distinct set of individuals whose foraging
area is based on a number of more or less permanent waterholes;
several of these "regional groups" make up a much larger tribal 
grouping typically based on a common dialect and occupancy of a
given geographical area (see Lee 1982). The temporary living
groups are drawn together into their larger regional groupings
for up to three months each year when they congregate at
traditional dry season camps based on what is often the only
permanent waterhole in the region. 
<P>Lee (1982) refers to this as a concentration/dispersal
social system and suggests that its origins lie in the
unpredictable nature of food and water sources in typical Bushman
habitats. He also argues that this form of flexible social system
is typical of most (if not all) modern hunter-gatherers:  rather
similar patterns of social organisation have been documented, for
example, among the Australian aboriginals (Meggitt 1965, Strehlow
1947), various Eskimo societies (Spencer 1959, Damas 1968), many
of the North American Indian  tribes (Helm 1968, Leacock 1969,
Steward 1938, Drucker 1955) and among the Congo pygmies (Turnbull
1968, Hewlett 1988). 
<P>Given this complexity, any attempt to determine the "true"
group size in hunter-gatherers would almost certainly be
challenged by anthropologists on innumerable ethnographic
grounds. In addition, two other more general objections might be
raised. One is that most surviving hunter-gatherers occupy
marginal habitats, and this may well influence both the size and
the structure of their social systems (as is known to be the case
with baboons, for example: Dunbar 1992a, in press). The second
is that most living hunter-gatherer societies have been seriously
disrupted, either directly or indirectly, by contact with modern
colonial cultures. 
<P>In view of these caveats, and rather than get involved in
the kind of fruitless argument about definitions that has so
often clouded the literature in this area, I will proceed more
cautiously and simply ask whether we find any groups at all that
are consistently of the size predicted for modern humans by
equation (1). Given the definition of grouping elaborated in the
Introduction, the central issue is not whether a particular form
of grouping occurs in every social system but whether a
particular size of grouping does so. 
<P>Unfortunately, ethnographers have not often regarded
censusses as an important feature of their investigations:
although most studies allude to groupings of different kinds and
often describe the structural relationships between them in great
detail, they seldom provide quantitative data on the sizes of
these groupings. Table 1 summarises all the data I have been
able to find in the ethnographic literature for a number of
historical and contemporary hunter-gatherer and swidden
horticulturalist societies. I have included swidden
horticulturalists since these may reasonably be considered to be
settled hunter-gatherers (see Johnson &amp; Earle 1987).
<P>The data in Table 1 suggest that group sizes fall into three
quite distinct size classes:  small living groups of 30-50
individuals (commonly measured as overnight camps, but often
referred to as bands in some of the hunter-gatherer literature),
a large population unit (the tribe or in some cases sub-tribe)
that typically numbers between 500 and 2500 individuals and an
intermediate level of grouping (either a more permanent village
or a culturally defined clan or lineage group) that typically
contains 100-200 people. In a few cases (e.g. the Mae Enga and
the Kaluli of New Guinea), more than three grouping layers were
identified by the ethnographer. Most such groupings are,
however, organised in a hierarchically inclusive fashion and I
have therefore identified the groupings that are closest to the
senses defined above. 
<P>Plotting these values on a graph produces what appears to
be a clear trimodal distribution of group sizes with no overlap
between grouping levels (Fig. 2). The average size of the
smallest and largest grouping levels (means of 37.7 and 1154.7,
respectively) correspond quite closely to the figures for bands
(30-50) and tribal groups (1000-2000) that are widely quoted in
the anthropological literature (e.g. Steward 1955, Service 1962). 
The level of grouping that appears to lie between these two has,
however, been given little more than passing attention (even
though the social significance of such groupings as clans have
been discussed extensively). This is reflected in the large
number of ? entries in Table 1, indicating that the ethnographer
discussed such a grouping but gave no indication of its actual
size.
<P>The average size of the intermediate level groups for those
societies for which accurate census data are available is 148.4
(range 90-221.5, N=9). If all the available data are considered
(taking median values in cases where only ranges are given), the
mean is 134.8 (N=15); if only nomadic hunter-gatherers are
considered, the mean is 156.4 (N=4). None of these estimates
differs  significantly  from  the  predicted  value  (z&lt; +0.431,
P&gt;0.667 2-tailed). Indeed, with one exception (the Mae Enga of
New Guinea), all the values given in Table 1 lie within the 95%
confidence limits of the predicted value (and even the exception
is only just outside the lower 95% confidence limit). More
importantly, in no case does the mean size of any temporary camp
or tribal grouping (i.e. the smaller and larger grouping types)
lie within the 95% confidence limits on the predicted group size. 
Indeed, the mean values for the band and tribal level groupings
are significantly different from the predicted value (z=6.401 and
z=9.631, respectively, P&lt;<0.0001).
<P>Note that the coefficient of variation for the intermediate
level grouping is considerably smaller than those for either of
the other two groupings (Table 1). This suggests that the
constraints on the former are greater than those on the latter,
as might be expected if the former is subject to an intrinsic
(e.g. cognitive) constraint whereas the latter are more often
determined by extrinsic environmental factors. The size of
hunter-gatherer "bands" (or night camps), for example, is known
to be particularly unstable and to be seasonally adjusted to the
group's resource base (Turnbull 1968, Lee 1982, Johnson &amp; Earle
1987). In contrast, the greater variability in the size of the
tribal level groupings almost certainly reflects the impact of
contact with modern (especially European) cultures and their
attendant diseases; in many cases, these have drastically reduced
the size of indigenous tribes. 
<P>It is important to note that the intermediate level
groupings do not always have an obvious physical manifestation. 
Whereas overnight camps can readily be identified as demographic
units in time and space and the tribal groupings can be
identified either by linguistic homogeneity or geographical
location (and often both), the intermediate level groupings are
often defined more in terms of ritual functions: they may gather
together once a year to enact rituals of special significance to
the group (such as initiation rites), but for much of the time
the members can be dispersed over a wide geographical area and,
in some cases, may even live with members of other clan
groupings. Nonetheless, what seems to characterise this level of
grouping is that it constitutes a subset of the population that
interacts on a sufficiently regular basis to have strong bonds
based on direct personal knowledge. My reading of the
ethnographies suggests that knowledge of individuals outside this
grouping is generally less secure and based more on gross
categories (a "Them" and "Us" basis as opposed to identifying
individuals by name). More importantly, perhaps, in the case of
New Guinea horticulturalists at least, the intermediate level
grouping seems to provide an outer network of individuals who can
be called on for coalitionary support during raids or the threat
of attack by other groups (see Meggitt 1965b, Hallpike 1977).
Thus, this intermediate level of grouping in human societies
seems to correspond rather precisely in both size and social
function to what we would expect on the basis of the nonhuman
primate data.
<P>It is of interest to note that estimates of the size of
Neolithic villages in Mesopotamia are of about the same
magnitude. Oates (1977), for example, gives a figure of 150-200,
based on the fact that 20-25 dwellings seems to be the typical
size of a number of village sites dated to around 6500-5500 BC. 
<P>In fact, it turns out that figures in the region of 150
occur frequently among a wide range of contemporary human
societies. Thus, the mean size of the 51 communities (or
Bruderhoefe) in the Schmedenleut section of the Hutterites (a
fundamentalist group who live and farm communally in South Dakota
and Manitoba) is 106.9 individuals (Mange &amp; Mange 1980).
According to Hardin (1988), the Hutterites regard 150 individuals
as the limiting size for their farming communities: once a
community reaches this size, steps are taken to split it into two
daughter communities. Bryant (1981) provides another example from
an East Tennessee rural mountain community (all of whom claim to
be related to each other and regard themselves as a single social
group): the total number of living members  was 197 when the
community was censussed at the end of the 1970s. Even academic
communities appear to abide by this rule. Price &amp; Beaver (1966),
for example, found that research specialities in the sciences
tend to consist of up to 200 individuals, but rarely more. Becher
(1989) sampled network sizes (defined as the number of
individuals whose work you pay attention to) in 13 academic sub-
disciplines drawn from both the sciences and the humanities and
concluded that the typical size of the outer circle of
professional associates that defines a sub-discipline is about
200 (with a range between 100-400). It seems that disciplines
tend to fragment with time as their numerical size (and, of
course, literature) grows. 
<P>In addition, it turns out that most organised (i.e.
professional) armies have a basic unit of about 150 men (Table
3). This was as true of the Roman Army (both before and after
the reforms of 104BC) as of modern armies since the sixteenth
century. In the Roman Army of the classical period (350-100 BC),
the basic unit was the maniple (or "double-century") which
normally consisted of 120-130 men; following the reforms
instituted by Marius in 104BC, the army was re-organised into
legions, each of which contained a number of semi-independent
centuries of 100 men each (Haverfield 1955, Montross 1975). The
smallest independent unit in modern armies (the company)
invariably contains 100-200 men (normallly three or four rifle
platoons of 30-40 men each, plus a headquarters unit, sometimes
with an additional heavy weapons unit) (Table 3). Although its
origins date back to the German mercenary Landsknechts groups of
the sixteenth century, the modern company really derives from the
military reforms of the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus in the
1620s. Despite subsequent increases in size to accomodate new
developments in weaponry and tactics, the company in all modern
armies has remained within the 95% confident limits of the
predicted size for human groups. The mean size of 179.6 for the
twentieth century armies listed in Table 3 does not differ
significantly from the 147.8 predicted by equation (1) (z=0.913,
P=0.361 2-tailed).
<P>This fact has particular significance in the context of the
present argument. Military units have to function very
efficiently in coordinating men's behaviour on the battlefield:
the price of failing to do so is extremely high and military
commanders cannot afford to miscalculate. Given that the fighting
power of a unit is a function of its size, we might expect there
to be considerable selection pressure in favour of units that are
as large as possible. That the smallest independent unit should
turn out to have a maximum size of about 200 even in modern
armies (where technology presumably facilitates the coordination
of planning) suggests that this upper limit is set by the number
of individuals who can work effectively together as a coordinated
team. Military planners have presumably arrived at this figure
as a result of trial and error over the centuries.
<P>In the context of the present analysis, the reason given by
the Hutterites for limiting their communities to 150 is
particularly illuminating. They explicitly state that when the
number of individuals is much larger than this, it becomes
difficult to control their behaviour by means of peer pressure
alone (Hardin 1988). Rather than create a police force, they
prefer to split the community. Forge (1972) came to a rather
similar conclusion on the basis of an analysis of settlement size
and structure among contemporary New Guinea "neolithic"
cultivators. He argued that the figure 150 was a key threshold
in community size in these societies. When communities exceed
this size, he suggested, basic relationships of kinship and
affinity were insufficient to maintain social cohesion; stability
could then be maintained only if formal structures developed
which defined specific roles within society. In other words,
large communities were invariably hierarchically structured in
some way, whereas small communities were not.
<P>Similarly, in an analysis of data from 30 societies ranging
from hunter-gatherers to large-scale agriculturalists, Naroll
(1956) demonstrated that there was a simple power relationship
between the maximum settlement size observed in a given society
and both the number of occupational specialities and the number
of organisational structures recorded for it. His analyses
suggest that there is a critical threshold at a maximum
settlement size of 500 beyond which social cohesion can only be
maintained if there is an appropriate number of authoritarian
officials. Bearing in mind that Naroll's threshold is expressed
as the maximum observed settlement size, it seems likely that the
equivalent mean settlement size will not be too far from the
value of 150 suggested by the above analyses.  
<P>Other evidence suggests that 150 may be a functional limit
on interacting groups even in contemporary western industrial
societies. Much of the sociometric research on industrial and
other comparable organisations, for example, has demonstrated
that there is a marked negative effect of group size on both
group cohesion and job satisfaction (as indicated by absenteeism
and turnover in posts) within the size range under consideration
(i.e. 50-500 individuals: see, for example, Indik 1965, Porter
&amp; Lawler 1965, Silverman 1970). Indeed, an informal rule in
business organisation identifies 150 as the critical limit for
the effective coordination of tasks and information-flow through
direct person-to-person links:  companies larger than this cannot
function effectively without sub-structuring to define channels
of communication and responsibility (J.-M. Delwart, pers.
commun.). Terrien &amp; Mills (1955), for example, found that the
larger the organisation, the greater the number of control
officials that is needed to ensure its smooth functioning. 
<P>Other studies have suggested that there is an upper limit
on the number of social contacts that can be regularly maintained
within a group. Coleman (1964) presented data on friendships
among print shop workers which suggest that the likelihood of
having friends within the workplace reaches an asymptote at a
shop size of 90-150 individuals. (The small size of the sample
for large groups makes it difficult to identify the precise point
at which "saturation" is reached.)  Coleman explicitly argued
that this was a consequence of the fact that there is a limit to
the number of individuals within a shop that any one person can
come into contact with. Moreover, his results also seemed to
suggest that the large number of regular interactants that an
individual can expect to have within a large work group limits
the number of additional friendships that can be made outside the
workplace.
<P>Most studies of social networks in modern urban societies
have tended to concentrate on specific sub-sets (e.g. "support
networks") within the wider network of "friends and
acquaintances" (see Mitchell 1969, Milardo 1988).  One exception
to this has been the study by Killworth et al (1984) who used a
"reversed small world" protocol to determine the total network
size (i.e. the total number of individuals that are known by name
with whom a respondent has a degree of personal contact). Forty
subjects were each given a dossier containing 500 fictious (but
realistic) target individuals living in different parts of the
world and asked to name an individual among their own
acquaintances who (either directly or via a chain of
acquaintances of their own) would be able to pass a message to
each of the targets. The number of different acquaintances listed
was assumed to be an index of the subject's total social network. 
The mean number of acquaintances selected was 134 (though the
variance around this figure was considerable). Since the number
of nominated acquaintances seems to increase more slowly as the
number of targets increases, Killworth et al (1984) suggested
that the asymptotic network size could be determined by
extrapolation from the rate at which the curve of nominated
acquaintances increases with increasing numbers of targets. They
calculated this value to be about 250. Though just outside the
95% confidence limits on the predicted value (z=2.29, P=0.022 2-
tailed), this latter estimate is not so far outside the range of
likely values as to be seriously worrying. For one thing, the
difference between the mean and asymptotic values may well
reflect the difference between the functional norm (i.e. the
number of personal friends that an individual has) and the
maximum network size when more peripheral acquaintances are
included. More research in this area is clearly needed to
clarify this.

<P>
3.2. Grooming and the Evolution of Language
<P>Given that primate groups are held together by social
grooming, time budget constraints on group size become an
important consideration (Dunbar 1992b). Even if a species has the
cognitive capacity to manage all the relationships involved in
large groups, there may be circumstances under which the animals
simply do not have the time available to devote to servicing
those relationships through social grooming. Relationships that
are not serviced in this way will cease to function effectively; 
as a result, the group will tend to disperse and the population
will settle at a new lower equilibrium group size (Dunbar 1992b).
<P>A comparative analysis of the determinants of time spent
grooming by primates has demonstrated that grooming time is a
linear function of group size, at least within the catarrhine
primates (Dunbar 1991). The distribution of the data suggests
that grooming does not necessarily function in such a way that
each individual grooms with every other group member:  rather,
as noted earlier (p.000), it suggests that the intensity of
grooming with a small number of "special friends" (or coalition
partners) increases in proportion to increasing group size. 
Irrespective of precisely how grooming functions to integrate
large primate groups, we can use the relationship between group
size and grooming time to predict the grooming time required to
maintain cohesion in groups of the size predicted for modern
humans.
<P>Since our main concern is with how time spent grooming
functions to maintain group cohesion, I have considered only
those catarrhine species which do not have fission-fusion social
systems. For the 22 species listed in Dunbar (1991, Table 1) that
are described as living in stable cohesive groups, the reduced
major axis regression equation is:
<P>G  =  -0.772 + 0.287 N                  (2)
where G is the percentage of time devoted to social grooming
during the day (r2=0.589, t20=5.36, P&lt;0.001: Fig. 3). (Logging
the data does not affect the value of r2, but produces impossibly
high values of grooming time for some primate populations as a
direct result of the transformation.)  The highest recorded value
for any individual species is 18.9% for one group of Papio papio
baboons (Sharman 1981), but a number of other baboon and macaque
groups exhibit grooming time allocations in the range 15-18% (see
for example Iwamoto &amp; Dunbar 1983). A figure of around 20% seems
to be an absolute upper limit on the amount of time that primates
can afford to devote to social interaction.
<P>(Alternative forms for equation [2] using least-squares
regression and/or the full Catarrhine data-set yield equations
that are very similar in form, but whose coefficients vary
somewhat. Although this affects the absolute values for the
grooming time requirement, it does not affect their relative
values; hence, the argument itself is unaffected. Equation [2]
seems to give a generally better fit to the primate data; in
particular, it yields a more accurate prediction of the amount
of time devoted to social grooming in the very large groups
typical of the gelada. I have preferred to use it here mainly
for this reason.)
<P>The group size predicted for modern humans by equation (1)
would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be
devoted to social grooming. (The 95% confidence limits on
predicted group size would yield grooming times that range from
28% to 66%.)  This is more than double that observed in any
population of nonhuman primates. Bearing in mind that this
figure refers to the average group size, and that many groups
will be substantially larger than this, the implications for
human time budgets are clearly catastrophic. A group of 200, for
instance, would have to devote 56.6% of its day to social
grooming. For any organism that also has to earn a living in the
real world, this would place a significant strain on its ability
to balance its time budget. This problem would clearly be
compounded if thermoregulatory considerations forced individuals
to take time out to rest in shade during the hottest parts of the
day: among baboons at least, temperature-driven resting appears
to be incompatible with social interaction (Dunbar 1992b).
<P>To place this in perspective in relation to relative
neocortex size in the hominoids, I have calculated the equivalent
figures for predicted group size and grooming time for all the
genera of hominoids (Table 3). (The fact that only the
chimpanzees live in groups of the size predicted by equation [1]
is not of significance in the present context: this point is
discussed in more detail in Dunbar [1992a].)  The question I want
to ask here is whether the neocortex size of non-human hominoids
is large enough to yield group sizes that would lead to a time-
budgetting crisis if the group's relationships had to be serviced
by social grooming alone. Table 3 suggests that, although group
size increases steadily through the hominoids, in no case is the
grooming time requirement predicted by equation (2) excessive by
the standards of other catarrhine primates. The figure of around
15% social time predicted for orang utans and chimpanzees
compares very favourably with the values actually observed among
baboons and macaques (see Dunbar 1991). Although larger bodied
apes would need to spend a rather higher proportion of their day
foraging than smaller-bodied baboons, the predicted grooming time
requirement is not such as to suggest that it would place
excessive pressure on their time budgets. Data summarised by
Wrangham (1986) indicate that the various chimpanzee populations
spend 25-43% of their time in non-foraging activities (mainly
resting and social interaction). None of these populations would
be forced to forgo any foraging time were they to spend as much
as 20% of their time in social grooming.
<P>The situation for modern humans is clearly very different
and such high grooming time requirements simply could not be met. 
In baboons, it has been shown that when the actual amount of time
devoted to social interaction is less than that predicted for a
group of the observed size, the group tends to fragment easily
during foraging and often subsequently undergoes fission (Dunbar
1992b). Faced with this problem, there are, in principle, only
two solutions:  either reduce group size to the point where the
amount of grooming time is manageable or use the time that is
available for social bonding in a more efficient way.
<P>Given that minimum group sizes are ecologically imposed
(see Dunbar 1988), there may be little that a particular species
can do to manipulate its group size in a particular habitat. The
only option will thus be a more efficient use of the time
available for social bonding. In this context, the main problem
with grooming as a bonding mechanism is that it is highly
inflexible:  it is all but impossible to do anything else while
grooming or being groomed. In addition, grooming is an
essentially dyadic activity:  only one other individual can be
groomed at a time. 
<P>Modern humans do, however, possess a form of social
communication that overcomes both of these limitations very
effectively:  not only can speech be combined with almost every
other activity (we can forage and talk at the same time), but it
can also be used to address several different individuals
simultaneously. Thus, language introduces major savings by
allowing an individual to do two different things at once. My
suggestion, then, is that language evolved as a "cheap" form of
social grooming, so enabling the ancestral humans to maintain the
cohesion of the unusually large groups demanded by the particular
conditions they faced at the time.
<P>
<P>
3.3. Language as a Bonding Mechanism
<P>That language (and hence speech) might have evolved as a
consequence of the need to increase group size raises the
question of just how it functions as a bonding mechanism.
Conventionally, language has always been interpreted in terms of
the exchange of information, and this has usually been understood
as being the exchange of information about the environment (e.g.
the location of prey, the coordination of behaviour during the
hunt). However, the social intelligence hypothesis for the
evolution of large brain size in primates (see Byrne &amp; Whiten
1988) implies that the acquisition and manipulation of social
knowledge is the primary consideration. The fact that language
can be interpreted as fulfilling the same role as social grooming
suggests that, rather than being the selective factor driving
brain evolution, ecologically-related information-exchange might
be a subsequent development that capitalised on a window of
opportunity created by the availability of a computer with a
substantial information-processing capacity.
<P>How might language function as a mechanism for social
bonding?  There would appear to be at least two possibilities.
One is by allowing individuals to spend time with their preferred
social partners, thereby enabling them to acquire information
about each other's behaviour by direct observation. This appears
to be one way in which social grooming itself might work (Dunbar
1988). That the intellectual content of human conversations is
often trivial (and, indeed, many conversations are highly
formulaic and ritualised) lends some support to this argument. 
The second possibility is that language permits the acquisition
of information about third party social relationships, thereby
enabling an individual to acquire knowledge of the behavioural
characteristics of other group members without actually having
to observe them in action. (I am grateful to R.W.Byrne for
pointing this out to me.)  This would have the effect of
considerably widening an individual's sphere of social knowledge
relative to what would be possible from direct personal
observation. This suggestion meshes well with the social
intelligence hypothesis, and is given some support by the extent
to which humans seem to be fascinated by gossip about other
people's behaviour.
<P>It is rather difficult to test unequivocally between these
two alternatives. In any case, it is not obvious that they are
necessarily mutually exclusive. However, it is clear that, if
the second explanation is true, gossip about third party social
relationships must constitute an important component of human
conversations. Table 4 summarises data on the content of
conversations in a university refectory. Approximately 38% of
conversation content was devoted to personal relationships
(either of those present or of third parties) and a further 24%
involved discussion of personal experiences of a more general
kind, both topics being clearly related to social knowledge.
Considering the potential importance of academic and other
intellectual topics of conversation in a university environment,
these are remarkably high values. The acquisition and exchange
of information about social relationships is clearly a
fundamental part of human conversation. I suggest that it
implies that this was the function for which it evolved.
<P>
<P>
3.4. Efficiency of Language as a Bonding Mechanism
<P>If language evolved purely as a form of vocal grooming in
order to facilitate the evolution of larger social groups, its
design properties should be of about the right efficiency
relative to grooming to allow an increase in group size from the
largest observed in nonhuman primates to those predicted for
modern humans. By "efficiency" here, I mean the number of
interactants that can be simultaneously reached during a social
interaction. In social grooming, this is necessarily one, because
grooming can only be a one-to-one interaction. Language would
thus need to allow proportionately as many individuals to be
interacted with at the same time as is necessary to raise the
size of nonhuman primate groups up to that predicted for modern
humans. 
<P>The observed mean group size for chimpanzees (presumably the
closest approximation to the ancestral condition for the hominid
lineage) is 53.5 (Dunbar 1992a). Since the predicted size for
human groups is 147.8, this implies that language (the human
bonding mechanism) ought to be 147.8/53.5=2.76 times as efficient
as social grooming (the nonhuman primate bonding mechanism). (The
figure would be 2.27 if we used the neocortex-predicted group
size of 62.5 given in Table 3 for chimpanzees.)  In terms of the
argument outlined here, this means that a speaker should be able
to interact with 2.8 times as many other individuals as a groomer
can. Since the number of grooming partners is necessarily
limited to one, this means that the limit on the number of
listeners should be about 2.8. In other words, human conversation
group sizes should be limited to about 3.8 in size (one speaker
plus 2.8 listeners).
<P>Table 5 summarises data on small group sizes from a number
of studies. Cohen (1971), for example, censussed the distribution
of group sizes from the reservations book for Novak's Restaurant
in Brookline (Mass.) over a 98 day period in 1968. Although the
distribution was double-peaked (with near equal modes at 2 and
4, as might be expected), the mean size of 3070 groups was 3.8.
(If groups of less than three people are excluded on the grounds
that they have other concerns that social interaction, then the
mean of 2020 groups is 4.8, but the modal group size is just 4
with a highly skewed distribution.)  James (1952) collated
information on the size of committees in a number of national and
local government institutions in the USA, as well as four
business corporations: mean size varied from 4.7 to 7.8 with
distributions that were highly skewed towards the low end. In a
study of freely forming groups in Portland (Oregon), James (1953)
found a mean group size of 2.7 (solitary individuals excluded)
on a public beach area. Group sizes were slightly smaller, but
comparable, in a variety of other social contexts (shopping
precincts, open streets, bus depots, school play grounds).
<P>The most direct evidence, however, comes from a study of
conversation group sizes carried out in a university refectory.
Dunbar &amp; Duncan (submitted) censussed conversational cliques that
formed freely within interacting groups that varied in size from
2-10 individuals. They found that the average number of people
directly involved in a conversation (as speaker or attentive
listener) reached an asymptotic value of about 3.4 (one speaker
plus 2.4 listeners) and that groups tended to partition into new
conversational cliques at multiples of about four individuals
(Fig. 4). 
<P>It turns out that there is, in fact, a psycho-physical limit
on the size of conversation groups. Due to the rate at which
speech attenuates with the distance between speaker and hearer
under normal ambient noise levels, there is a physical limit on
the number of individuals that can effectively take part in a
conversation. Sommer (1961), for example, found that a nose-to-
nose distance of 1.7m was the upper limit for comfortable
conversation in dyadic groups; this would yield a maximum
conversation group size of five individuals with a shoulder-to-
shoulder spacing of 0.5m between adjacent individuals standing
around the circumference of a circle. 
<P>Theoretical and empirical studies of signal-attenuation
rates suggest that, as the circle of interactees expands with
increasing group size, the distances between speaker and
listeners across the circle rapidly become too large for
conversations to be heard (Beranek 1954, Webster 1965, Cohen
1971). In addition, Webster (1965) found that a doubling of the
distance between speaker and hearer reduces by about 6 Db the
level of background noise that can be tolerated for any given
criterion of speech recognition accuracy, with the reduction
being proportionately greater for those with lighter voices (e.g.
women). Cohen's (1971) analyses of these results suggested that
at background noise levels typical of both offices and city
streets, conversational groups will be limited to a maximum of
seven individuals if they maintain a spacing distance of about
0.5m apart even when they speak in a raised voice; groups of five
would be the limit with normal voice levels. 
<P>Although background noise levels in natural environments are
unlikely to approach those found on busy city streets, comparably
high noise levels are commonly found in large interacting human
groups. Legget &amp; Northwood (1960) measured maximum noise levels
at cocktail parties of 120-640 people (including a coffee party
for librarians!): they found noise levels that were typically in
the region 80-85 Db in the mature stages of these parties. This
is considerably in excess of the noise levels recorded in city
streets and only just below the level sufficient to induce
hearing impairment. At such levels, speech recognition is close
to zero, conversation becomes impossible and maximum group size
approaches one (see Cohen 1971, Fig. 7.1). Such noise levels may
not be untypical of the periodic ritual social gatherings of
primitive societies at which relationships are renewed and social
gossip about third parties exchanged.
<P>In summary, these results suggest that conversation does
meet the requirements of a more efficient bonding mechanism, and
that it does so at about the level relative to social grooming
that is required to facilitate an increase in group size from
those observed in nonhuman primates. Moreover, the psycho-
physical properties of human speech provide some evidence to
suggest that they are correlated with these demographic
characteristics of human groups.
<P>
<P>
<P>4. Discussion
<P>
<P>The essence of my argument has been that there is a
cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one
person can maintain stable relationships, that this limit is a
direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this in turn
limits group size. The predicted group size for humans is
relatively large (compared to those for nonhuman primates), and
is close to observed sizes of certain rather distinctive types
of groups found in contemporary and historical human societies. 
These groups are invariably ones that depend on extensive
personal knowledge based on face-to-face interaction for their
stability and coherence through time. I argued that the need to
increase group size at some point during the course of human
evolution precipitated the evolution of language because a more
efficient process was required for servicing these relationships
than was possible with the conventional nonhuman primate bonding
mechanism (namely, social grooming). These arguments appear to
mesh well with the social intelligence hypothesis for the
evolution of brain size and cognitive skills in primates.
<P>Three points should be noted. One is that there is no
obligation on particular human societies to live in groups of the
predicted size:  the suggestion here is simply that there is an
upper limit on the size of groups that can be maintained by
direct personal contact. This limit reflects demands made on the
ancestral human populations at some point in their past history. 
Once neocortex size has evolved, other factors may of course
dictate the need for smaller groups. Precisely this effect seems
to occur in gibbons and orang utans: in both cases, neocortex
size predicts groups substantially larger than those observed for
these species, but ecological factors apparently dictate smaller
groups (Wrangham 1979). Thus, the observation that Australian
Aboriginal tribes living in the central desert regions lack the
larger clan-like groups does not necessarily disprove the
hypothesis. The marginal habitats occupied by these peoples seems
to dictate a foraging strategy based on small dispersed groups
living in very large territories; this almost certainly creates
communication problems that preclude the formation of larger
social networks. The hypothesis would be invalidated, however,
if there was no evidence for clan-like groupings in more
productive environments. 
<P>(It is, incidentally, worth observing that we might expect
the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social
dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less
often and will thus be less familiar with each, so group sizes
should be smaller in consequence; in spatially concentrated
societies, on the other hand, individuals will see each other
more often and group sizes should be proportionately larger.)
<P>The second point is that the limit imposed by neocortical
processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with
whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained. This
in no sense commits us to any particular way of structuring those
groups (e.g. via kinship). Although the layers of grouping listed
in Table 1 are often based on biological relatedness (involving
the successive fission of what are usually termed segmentary
lineages: see for example Meggitt 1965b), there is no requirement
that groups necessarily have to be organised on genetic
principles. Kinship is one dimension of primate societies that
is relevant to individuals' decisions about whom to group with,
and it often provides a convenient means for structuring a
hierarchically inclusive pattern of grouping (see Dunbar 1988). 
However, even among nonhuman primates, it is not the only basis
on which individuals choose whom to form groups and/or alliances
with (see Cheney 1983). Primate groups are, strictly speaking,
coalitions based on common interest and any number of biological,
economic and social dimensions besides kinship may be relevant
in individual cases (see, for example, de Waal &amp; Luttrell 1986).
<P>Finally, it should be noted that this explanation clearly
stands in direct contrast to the conventional wisdom that
language developed in the context of hunting to enable early
hominids to communicate about the location of possible prey and
to plan coordinated hunting expeditions. Indeed, the explanation
for the increase in brain size within the hominid lineage on
which my argument is based itself stands in contradiction to the
conventional wisdom that these large brains evolved to enable
humans to hunt and/or manufacture tools. Others (e.g. Wynn 1988;
see also Blumenberg 1983) have already pointed out that the
evolution of large brain size within the hominid lineage does not
correlate well with the archaeological record for changes in tool
construction. The markedly improved tool designs of the Upper
Palaeolithic can thus be better interpreted as a consequence
rather than a cause of enlarged brain size.
<P>This analysis raises a number of additional questions. (1)
At what point during the process of human evolution from the
common pongid ancestor did such unusually large groups (and hence
language) evolve?  (2) How is it that, despite these apparent
cognitive constraints on group size, modern human societies are
nonetheless able to form super-large groups (e.g. nation states)? 
(3) To what extent is language a uniquely novel solution confined
to the hominid lineage?
<P>The fossil evidence (see Aiello &amp; Dean 1990) suggests that
brain size increased exponentially through time within the
hominid lineage, being well within the pongid range for the
Australopithecus species and not showing a marked increase until
the appearance of Homo sapiens. This would tend to suggest that
neocortex sizes are unlikely to have been sufficiently large to
push the grooming time requirement through the critical threshold
at about 25-30% of the time budget until quite late in hominid
evolution. Application of equations (1) and (2) to all the
fossil hominids for which cranial capacity estimates are
available identifies the appearance of archaic Homo sapiens at
about 250,000 years BP as the point at which language most likely
evolved (Aiello &amp; Dunbar, submitted). (It turns out that
neocortex ratio is a simple allometric function of cranial
capacity in all primates, including humans, with a very high
coefficient of determination, thus allowing us to determine group
sizes even for extinct species.)  Language would thus have been
a rather late evolutionary development. Just why early humans
should have found it necessary to evolve such large groups
remains uncertain, however, and there is little that can usefully
be said to clarify this point at present (for further discussion,
see Aiello &amp; Dunbar, submitted). 
<P>(Let me forestall at least one line of criticism at this
point by observing that the fact that we cannot identify a
functional explanation to account for the evolution of a trait
does not invalidate the fact that such a trait has evolved: it
merely signals our limited knowledge. Humans clearly have larger
group sizes than nonhuman primates, and groups of that size
cannot have appeared by magic for no good reason. Whether we can
ever answer that question will ultimately depend on whether we
can extract the relevant information from the fossil record. It
will also, however, depend on our developing theories of
sufficient complexity to allow us to understand the interactions
between the various components within what is inevitably a
complex socio-ecological system (Tooby &amp; DeVore 1987, Dunbar
1989b).) 
<P>The second issue concerns the fact that contemporary human
societies are able to maintain very large groupings indeed (in
the order of several hundred million individuals in a modern
nation state). Two observations are worth making here. One is
that the structure of these super-large groupings is not
particularly stable through time, as has repeatedly been
demonstrated in history by the eventual collapse of most large
empires. The other is that language has two unusual properties
that make it possible to form groups that are substantially
larger than the 150-200 predicted by neocortex size: it allows
us (1) to categorise individuals into types and (2) to instruct
other individuals as to how they should behave towards specific
types of individuals within society. Thus, we can specify that
individuals identified as a class by a particular badge (for
example a clerical collar or a sherrif's badge) should be treated
in a certain rather specific way (e.g. with great deference). 
A naive individual will thus know how to respond appropriately
to a member of that class on first meeting even though s/he has
never previously encountered that particular individual before.
This may be especially important in the case of those types of
individuals (e.g. royalty, bishops, etc) that the average citizen
does not normally have the opportunity to meet. Subsequent more
intimate interactions may, of course, allow the relationship to
be fine-tuned in a more appropriate way, but conventional rules
of this kind at least make it possible to avoid the initial risk
of souring a potential relationship by inappropriate behaviour
at the first meeting.
<P>This ability to categorise individuals into types clearly
makes it possible to create very much larger groups than is
possible by direct interaction. It is only necessary to learn how
to behave towards a general type of individual, rather than
having to learn the nature of each individual relationship. By
structuring relationships hierarchically in this way, social
groups of very substantial size can in principle be built up. 
The obvious example is, once again, the hierarchical structuring
of military units. Notice that, even in this case, members of
different groupings are often given distinctive badges or
uniforms in order to allow them to be identified easily: this
applies not only to categories of individuals who are considered
to be "important" (e.g. officers) but also to members of
different types of unit who are of equivalent status in the
hierarchy (e.g. military policemen, marines, different regiments,
etc).
<P>It is significant, however, that larger groupings of this
size appear to be very much less cohesive than groups that are
smaller than the critical limit. Language seems to be a far from
perfect medium for acquiring detailed social knowledge about
other individuals: secondhand knowledge, it seems, is a poor
substitute for the real thing. Indeed, it is conspicuous that
when we do want to establish very intense relationships, we tend
to do so through the much more primitive medium of physical
contact rather than through language. The kind of "mutual
mauling" in which we engage under these circumstances bears a
striking resemblance to social grooming in other primates -- and
suffers from all its disadvantages. One study of social grooming
in a natural human population, for example, found that 92% of all
grooming interactions were dyadic (Sugawara 1984). In this
context, it is relevant to note that sociometric studies of
"sympathy groups" suggest that we are only able to maintain very
intense relationships with 10-12 other individuals at any one
time (Buys &amp; Larson 1979).
<P>The final issue is the purely phylogenetic one of where
language might have evolved from within the natural communication
patterns of primates. Can we identify any features of nonhuman
primate vocal communication that could function as a natural
precursor for human language?  The obvious analogy lies in the
contact calls used extensively in many species of anthropoid
primates to coordinate spacing between individuals of the same
group. Although these calls have traditionally been interpreted
as a mechanism for maintaining contact during movement (hence
their generic name), it has become clear in recent years that
there may be more subtle layers of meaning to these calls. Cheney
&amp; Seyfarth (1982), for example, found that vervet monkeys use
contact calls to comment on events or situations as they occur.
They were able to show experimentally that slight differences in
the acoustical form of the calls allow the audience to infer a
great deal about the event or situation on which the caller is
commenting, even in the complete absence of any visual
information.
<P>So far, rather little work has been done on the phonetic
structure of primate contact calls. The one exception here has
been the gelada, whose vocalisations have been analysed in
considerable detail by Richman (1976, 1978, 1987). Richman
(1976) found that gelada are able to produce sounds that are
synonymous with the vowel and consonant sounds (notably
fricatives, plosives and nasals, as well as sounds articulated
in different parts of the vocal tract such as labials, dentals
and velars) that were hitherto thought to be distinctive features
of human speech. Furthermore, Richman (1987) has pointed out
that the gelada's highly synchronised exchanges of contact calls
(see  also Richman 1978) possess many of the rhythmic and melodic
properties of human speech patterns. The conversational nature
of these exchanges led Richman (1987) to suggest that gelada use
these musical qualities to designate utterance acts so as to
permit hearers to parse the sound sequence into smaller units in
just the way that humans do when talking. He specifically related
this ability to the social context, in particular the need to
resolve the emotional conflicts inherent in many social
situations. It is significant that, in the gelada, calling and
counter-calling between individuals is closely related to the
strength of the relationship between them (see Kawai 1979, Dunbar
1988, p.251).
<P>We do not at present know whether the acoustic features
identified by Richman are unique to the gelada. They might well
not be. However, the conversational properties of gelada contact
calls (in particular their use in highly synchronised bouts,
often involving intense emotional overtones) do seem to be
unusual. It may therefore be significant that gelada live in the
largest naturally occurring groups of any nonhuman primate: the
average size of their rather loosely structured bands (a high
level grouping within an extended hierarchically organised social
system based on a very much smaller stable reproductive unit) is
about 110 (see Iwamoto &amp; Dunbar 1983). 
<P>Clearly, the gelada have in no sense evolved language in the
sense we would use this term of humans, but then neither have
they developed the large cohesive groups chararcteristic of our
species. However, it may be that the large groups in which this
species sometimes gathers forced the evolution of a supplementary
vocal mechanism for servicing relationships in a context where
they are already at the limit of available grooming time (see
Iwamoto &amp; Dunbar 1983, Dunbar 1991). It is worth noting that
this much has been achieved without the need to increase
neocortex size: indeed, the gelada have a rather small neocortex
compared to their baboon cousins (genus Papio) which probably
explains the lack of cohesiveness in their larger-scale groups
compared to those of the baboons. 
<P>This would seem to suggest that many of the basic properties
of speech and language were already available in the more
advanced nonhuman primates. What was required was their close
integration and elaboration, and this may have been dependent on
a significant increase in neocortex size in order to provide the
necessary computing capacity. I simply suggest that the
evolution of this increased capacity arose out of the need to
coordinate the large number of inter-personal relationships
necessary to maintain the cohesion and stability of larger than
normal groups.

a)  Some sources only give a range in group size. ? indicates

<P>enthnographer, but no census data are given; - indicates
<P>that the grouping specifically does not occur.
b)  Settled hunter-gatherers or traditional horticulturalists
<P>living in permanent villages.
c)  The values are, respectively, the mean size of clans, tribes
<P>and dialects, as defined by Hallpike (1977), from a total
<P>language group of about 8700; this interpretation is closest
<P>to the useage in the present paper.
d)  The values are, respectively, the mean size of patrilineages,
<P>sub-clans (clans in parentheses) and phratries, as defined
<P>by Meggitt (1965b), from a total tribal group estimated at
<P>60,000;  see comment on footnote (c).
e)  Helm (1968) quotes sizes as numbers of "conjugal pairs"; I
<P>have assumed an average of 3 living children per conjugal
<P>pair.
f)  Mean number of residents in a longhouse.
g)  Mean size of "population blocs" of Chagnon (1979) from a
<P>total Yanomano population estimated to be about 15,000.
h)  For societies in which actual census data are given.
i)  The larger value for the Mae Enga would give a mean of 177.3;
