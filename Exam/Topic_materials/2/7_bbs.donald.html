<H2>Abstract</H2>
This book was an attempt to synthesize various sources of
information--neurobiological, psychological, archeological and
anthropological, among others--about our cognitive origins, in
the belief that the human mind co-evolved in close interaction
with both brain and culture.  I should make clear from the start
that I have no illusions about my ability to become expert in all
of the disciplines touched on by this enterprise; accordingly my
effort should be regarded with suspicion by all; at best, it will
probably prove to be no more than a guide to some of the
important questions that remain to be settled.  This precis
focuses on my core theory and disregards most of the background
material reviewed at length in the book itself.
<HR>
<P>My central hypothesis is that there were three major
cognitive transformations by which the modern human mind emerged
over several million years, starting with a complex of skills
presumably resembling those of the chimpanzee.  These
transformations left, on the one hand, three new, uniquely human
systems of memory representation, and on the other, three
interwoven layers of human culture, each supported by its
corresponding set of representations.  I agree with multilevel
evolutionary theorists like Plotkin (1988) who believe that
selection pressures at this stage of human evolution were
ultimately expressed and tested on the sociocultural level; hence
I have described the evolutionary scenario as a series of
cultural adaptations, even though individual cognition was really
where the main event was taking place, since it provides the
linkage between physical and cultural evolution.
<P>
<P>In one sense the proposed evolutionary sequence is an
exercise in interpolation not unlike many other efforts that have
attempted to construct a credible case for the emergence of
particular morphological and behavioral features in various
species.  But in another it is a structural theory that confronts
the question of how many processing levels must be interposed
between the nonsymbolic cognitions of animals, and the fully
symbolic representations of humans.  Symbolic representation is
the principal cognitive signature of humans, and the main
phenomenon whose arrival on the scene has to be accounted for in
any scenario of human evolution.
<P>
<P>The theory posits a series of radical evolutionary changes--
the punctuations, as it were, in punctuated equilibrium--rather
than a continuous or unitary process.  I do not rule out the
possibility, indeed the likelihood, of smaller graduated changes
that might also have occurred during the long period of human
emergence; but judging from the anatomical and cultural remains
left by hominids and early humans, the most important
evolutionary steps were concentrated into a few transition
periods when the process of change was greatly accelerated, and
these major transitions introduced fundamentally new capacities.
<P>
<P>I have made certain hard choices--for instance, I have opted
for a late-language model, placing language near the end of the
human evolutionary story rather than much earlier, as Parker &amp;
Gibson (1979), and Bickerton (1990) have.  For another, I have
opted for a lexically-driven model of language evolution, rather
than placing the main emphasis on phonology as Lieberman (1984)
has, or on grammar as Bickerton (1990) has.  In fact I have
portrayed our capacity for lexical invention as a single pivotal
adaptation capable of evolving into an instrument of sufficient
power to support all of the higher aspects of language.
<P>
<P>Moreover, I have postulated an early motor adaptation,
intermediate between ape cognition and language, that gives
primacy to the unique motor and nonverbal cognitive skills of
humans.  In this I am in basic agreement with Kimura (1976) and
Corballis (1989; 1991) who have also argued for an early motor
adaptation that preceded speech.  However I differ from these two
authors in that I am much less concerned with the issue of
cerebral laterality, and more focussed on the representational
possibilities inherent in an early motor adaptation.  Moreover, I
do not agree with them about the close qualitative linkage
between language and serial motor skill; I see the two as
qualitatively different, albeit interdependent, adaptations.
<P>
<P>I have also tried to build a theory in such a way that
specific details of chronology are not crucial to its central
hypothesis, which is essentially concerned with cognitive
succession, and consequent modern cognitive structure.  Finally,
I have chosen to construct my succession hypothesis around a
fairly simple unifying theme, that of evolving cognitive
architecture.  This is based on my belief that brains store
memories in and around their functional processors rather than
somewhere else, as most computers do; and therefore that
radically new representational strategies signal the likelihood
of a change in the underlying neuropsychological architecture
(keeping in mind that such changes may be anatomically complex).
<P>
Chronology, succession and transition.  Chronology is important
in that it helps us establish an order of succession, and
determine how many major cognitive steps were taken, and roughly
when.  This issue was not as difficult to resolve as one might
have expected, given the controversy that seems to pursue
archeological finds.  There is considerable stability in the
basic number of hominid species that are currently interposed
between humans and Miocene apes, and in their order of
appearance.  Moreover, there is agreement that although
australopithecines undoubtedly underwent massive anatomical and
cultural change in adopting erect posture, they did not leave any
evidence suggesting major cognitive evolution.  There appear to
be only two strong candidates for a major breakpoint in hominid
cognitive evolution, and these coincide with the transition
periods leading to the speciation of Homo erectus (about -1.5 M
years) and archaic Homo sapiens (roughly -0.3 M years),
respectively.  Four recent books on this subject (Bickerton,
1990; Lieberman, 1991; Corballis, 1991; and Donald, 1991) have
all agreed on this basic point.
<P>
<P>The relative brain size of Homo erectus was much larger than
that of previous hominids, eventually exceeding 70% of the modern
human brain.  The linear upward trend of hominid brain size
accelerated sharply during the transition to Homo erectus, and
was sustained until Homo sapiens emerged (Lieberman, 1991).  This
rapid increase in cerebral volume was concentrated in the
association cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.  Even taken in
isolation of cultural artifacts, these anatomical facts would
suggest a significant cognitive change.  But the cultural
evidence left by Homo erectus strongly confirms the presence of
major cognitive evolution: Homo erectus manufactured quite
sophisticated stone tools, devised long-distance hunting
strategies, and migrated out of Africa over much of the Eurasian
landmass.
<P>
<P>A second major transition period preceded the speciation of
Homo sapiens and was marked by another large brain expansion and
the descent of the larynx.  As Lieberman (1984) has argued, the
latter probably coincided with the emergence of spoken language
as we know it, that is, with the arrival of a high-speed vocal
communication system driven by a large lexicon containing
thousands of entries.  Their exact lineage is still not known,
but modern humans appear to have reached their present form
sometime prior to 45,000 years ago.  All modern humans have a
fully developed speech capacity, as well as complex oral cultures
that incorporate myth, religion, and social ritual.  This would
suggest that our final period of major biological change extended
over the late Middle and early Upper Paleolithic periods.
<P>
<P>My decision to postulate a third transition in human
cognitive evolution takes this scenario out of the realm of
purely biological evolution, towards a definition of evolution
that is at once broader and more purely cognitive.  If the
descriptive criteria for major cognitive transitions are held
constant throughout human history and prehistory, it is obvious
that there have been some very major changes since the Upper
Paleolithic.  The likelihood that the specific mechanism of such
recent change is non-genetic should not distract us from making
that observation, and exploring it to the fullest.  Recent
cognitive change is evident primarily in cultural artifacts, and
might have been classified along many different continua; I have
singled out the development of external memory as the critical
issue.  The third transition seems to have started in the late
Upper Paleolithic with the invention of the first permanent
visual symbols, and is still underway.
<P>
Structural issues.  Here, the main structural questions are: what
new cognitive features were introduced at each of these three
stages?  And how do these three developments coalesce in the
modern brain and mind, and express themselves in culture?  In my
proposal all three stages introduced new memory features into the
human cognitive system, and one important consequence has been
greatly improved voluntary access to memory representations; in
effect, humans have evolved the architecture needed to support
what Graf &amp; Schacter (1985) have called "explicit" memory
retrieval.
<P>
<P>The first transition introduced two fundamentally new
cognitive features: a supramodal, motor-modelling capacity called
mimesis, which created representations that had the critical
property of voluntary retrievability.  The second transition
added two more features: a capacity for lexical invention, and a
high-speed phonological apparatus, the latter being a specialized
mimetic subsystem.  The third transition introduced external
memory storage and retrieval, and a new working memory
architecture.
<P>
<P>The structural arrangement of these uniquely human
representational systems is hierarchical, with mimetic skill
serving as a necessary but not sufficient condition for language,
while language capacity is a necessary condition for the
invention of external memory devices.  All of these
representational systems are at the high-end of the system, and
are aspects of what is sometimes vaguely called the "central
processor" (see especially Fodor, 1983).  This proposal therefore
implies that the human version of the central processor has
evolved through a series of major changes, and is now complex and
quasi-modular in its internal structure.
<P>
The starting point: the abilities of apes
<P>
<P>Apes are brilliant event-perceivers; as I have acknowledged
in my book, they have a significant capacity for social
attribution, insight and deception, and great sensitivity to the
significance of environmental events. In the latter category, I
include the signing systems provided by human trainers; they are
best treated as complex environmental events, or challenges, to
which apes respond with their usual perspicuity (see, for
instance, Savage-Rumbaugh, 1980).
<P>
<P>I agree with Olton's (1984) suggestion that apes have
episodic memory, that is the ability to store their perceptions
of specific episodes (a position that Tulving (1984) evidently
agrees with).  However, they have very poor episodic recall,
because they cannot self-trigger their memories: that is, they
have great difficulty in gaining voluntarily access to the
contents of their own episodic memories independently of
environmental cues.  Thus they are largely environmentally-
driven, or conditioned, in their behavior, and show very little
independent thought that is not directly related to specific
episodes.  I have called their style of thought and culture
"episodic."
<P>
<P>The limits of ape intelligence seem to be especially evident
on the production side of the cognitive system.  Bright as their
event-perceptions reveal them to be, they cannot express that
knowledge.  This limitation stems from their inability either to
actively shape and modify their own actions, or to voluntarily
access their own stored representations.  This might be why they
cannot seem to invent gestures or mimes to communicate even the
simplest intention (see, for instance, Crawford, cited in Munn,
1971).  They can learn signs made available by human trainers,
but they do not invent them on their own; nor do they seem to
consciously "model" their patterns of movement, in the sense of
reflecting on them, experimenting with them, and pushing them to
the limits, the way humans do.  This seems to indicate that they
are far less developed than humans in at least two areas of motor
control: the construction of conscious action-models, and the
independent voluntary retrieval of such models.
<P>
<P>Without easy independent access to voluntary motor-memories,
even simple operations like self-cued rehearsal and purposive
refinement of one's own skill are impossible, because the
cognitive system remains primarily reactive, designed to react to
real-world situations as they occur, and not to represent or
reflect on them.  Thus apes are not good at improving their
skills through systematic rehearsal.  The contrast with human
children in this regard is striking: some apes might throw
projectiles in a fight, but they do not systematically practice
and improve their throwing skill, the way human children do.  The
same applies to other kinds of voluntary action; children
actively and routinely rehearse and refine all kinds of action,
including facial expressions, vocalizations, climbing, balancing,
building things, and so on.  While apes may have the same basic
repertoire of acts, they do not rehearse and refine them, at
least not on their own.  In fact, it takes an incredible amount
of training--of the order of thousands of trials--just to
establish a single reliable naming response in chimps, and even
those very context-specific responses remain reactive and
episodic: for example, 97% of Kanzi's signing consists of direct
requests (Greenfield &amp; Savage-Rumbaugh, 1990).  Until hominids
were able to model their actions and their episodic event-
perceptions, and access those representations independently of
environmental stimulation, they, like all higher mammals before
them, were locked into an episodic life style, no matter how
sophisticated their event-perceptions had become.
<P>
First transition: mimetic skill and autocueing
<P>
<P>The rationale for the first transition is based on several
premises: (a) the first truly human cognitive breakthrough was a
revolution in motor skill--mimetic skill--which enabled hominids
to use the whole body as a representational device; (b) this
mimetic adaptation had two critical features: it was a multimodal
modelling system, and it had a self-triggered rehearsal loop
(that is, it could voluntarily access and retrieve its own
outputs); (c) the sociocultural implications of mimetic skill are
considerable, and could explain the documented achievements of
Homo erectus; (d) in modern humans, mimetic skill in its broadest
definition is dissociable from language-based skills, and retains
its own realm of cultural usefulness; and (e) the mimetic motor
adaptation set the stage for the later evolution of language.
<P>
(a) The primacy of motor evolution.  The first really major
cognitive breakthrough, and the appearance of the first truly
human-like species, seems to have occurred with Homo erectus.
The question commonly asked is: do we need to attribute some
language capacity to this species?  This is inherently a
structural question, since it asks whether language--rather,
symbolic thought--is primary in the human cognitive hierarchy.
Placing language this early in evolution, giving it this primacy,
is a vote for a symbol-based, computational model of all human
thinking.
<P>
<P>The evidence supporting the premise that Homo erectus was
unlikely to have had language, has been reviewed in several
places (most extensively by Lieberman 1984, 1991; but also by
Corballis, 1991; and Donald, 1991).  No modern investigator has
argued that Homo erectus had speech or anything like it.
However, to explain achievements like toolmaking and social
coordination, several authors have attributed to Homo erectus a
limited degree of linguistic capacity, usually labelled "proto-
language" (Parker &amp; Gibson, 1983; and Bickerton, 1990).  The
current form of this notion is that Homo erectus had the
linguistic capabilities of a two-year old child, namely one and
two-word utterances, and intentional gesturing, but no grammar
(Bickerton, 1990).  This seems feasible, since there have been
claims that apes are very close to achieving this (see, for
instance, Greenfield &amp; Savage-Rumbaugh, 1990).
<P>
<P>But there are serious problems with this position.  For one
thing, it puts the cart before the horse; it leaves out a prior
motor adaptation without which language could never have evolved.
In reality, apes are not even close to two-year-old children in
the way they use symbols, except perhaps in their perceptions of
the utility of symbols.  On the motor side, they cannot even
match what infants achieve during the babbling phase, let alone
later on when children acquire reference, because apes cannot
rehearse and refine movement on their own, or create models of
reality on their own.  Early language theories of evolution are
seeking a "quick fix" solution, a rapid leap to some form of
language without attending to the more fundamental motoric
changes that must have preceded it.  (In the process, of course,
these theories also sustain the A/I agenda that attributes all
higher cognition to some sort of symbolizing process: see
Dennett, 1992).
<P>
<P>The primacy of motor evolution is central to any credible
phylogenetic account of language.  Before they could invent a
lexicon, hominids had first to acquire a capacity for the
voluntary retrieval of stored motor memories, and this retrieval
had to become independent of environmental cueing.  Secondly,
they had to acquire a capacity for actively modelling and
modifying their own movement.  Without these two features, the
motor production system could not break the stranglehold of the
environment.  Any language system assumes the ability of the
speaker both to actively construct communicative acts, and to
retrieve them on demand.  In other words, the system must first
gain a degree of control over its own outputs before it can
create a lexicon, and before it can construct a grammatical
framework governing the use of such a lexicon.
<P>
<P>This is critical from the viewpoint of cognitive theory, but
one might still ask, given that an early motor adaptation was a
logical necessity, couldn't it have occurred much earlier,
perhaps in the australopithecines, and don't we still need
language in some form to account for Homo erectus?  I argue that
a revolution in nonverbal motor skill would have had immediate
and very major consequences in the realms of representation and
social expression.  These alone, without any further evolution,
can account for the kinds of skills that have been documented in
the culture of Homo erectus; they can also account for many of
the nonverbal skills of modern humans.
<P>
<P>There is another good reason for asserting the primacy of
motor evolution: language is not the only uniquely human
attribute that must be explained in an account of cognitive
evolution (cf Premack, 1987).  A good theory of the first
cognitive evolutionary steps of humans should try to account for
as many human nonverbal skills as possible.  This leads to the
first proposal of my theory: the first major cognitive transition
broke the hold of the environment on hominid motor behavior, and
provided hominids with a new means of representing reality.  The
form of the adaptation was a revolutionary, supramodal
improvement in motor control called "mimetic skill."
<P>
(b) Mimetic action as a unified supramodal system.  Mimetic
action is basically a talent for using the whole body as a
communication device, for translating event-perceptions into
action.  Its underlying modelling principle is perceptual
metaphor; thus it might also be called action-metaphor.  It is
the most basic human thought-skill, and remains fundamentally
independent of our truly linguistic modes of representation.
Mimesis is based in a memory system that can rehearse and refine
movement voluntarily and systematically, guided by a perceptual
model of the body in its surrounding environment, and store and
retrieve the products of that rehearsal.  It is based on an
abstract "model of models" that allows any voluntary action of
the body to be stopped, replayed, and edited, under conscious
control.  This is inherently a voluntary access route to memory,
since the product of the model is an implementable self-image.
<P>
<P>The principle of voluntary retrievability, which might be
called "autocueing," was thus established at the top end of the
motor system.  Autocueing is perhaps the most critical unifying
feature of mimetic skill.  Only humans can recall memories at
will; and the most basic form of human recall is the self-
triggered rehearsal of action, the refinement of action by
purposive repetition.  Purposive rehearsal reveals the presence
of a unified self-modelling process, and most importantly, the
whole body becomes a potential source of conscious
representation.  Retrievable body-memories were thus the first
true representations, and also the most basic form of reflection,
since the mimetic motor act itself represents something:
systematic rehearsal "refers" to the rehearsed act itself,
comparing each exemplar with a sort of idealized version of
itself.
<P>
<P>The human mimetic mechanism is supramodal at the output:
that is, it can employ any part of the skeletal musculature in
constructing a representation.  It is supramodal at the input as
well, since it can also utilize input from any major sense
modality or perceptual system for its modelling purposes.  A
mimetic re-enactment of an event--say a toolmaking sequence--
might employ the eyes, hands, feet, posture, locomotion, voice,
or any combination of these, while the event itself might have
been experienced through a variety of sensory modalities.
Moreover a given event can be mimetically represented in various
acted-out versions.  It follows that a mimetic act is a
manifestation of a highly abstract modelling process.
<P>
<P>The existence of a unified central "controller" for body
mimesis is revealed most clearly in the unique human propensity
for rhythm.  Humans seem unable to resist rhythm; and even very
young children spontaneously imitate, rehearse, and modify the
rhythmic sounds and actions around them, with varying degrees of
sophistication.  The transferability of rhythm to virtually any
skeletomuscular system in the body reveals the abstractness of
human mimetic action-modelling: rhythms can be transferred from
one muscle group to another, singly or in combination.  For
instance, a sound rhythm initially modelled by the fingers can be
transferred to the feet, or to the axial locomotor systems (as it
is in dance), or to the head, face, eyes, tongue, voice; or to
any subset of these in combination.  Rhythm is thus an excellent
paradigm for mimetic skill, in which an abstract perceptual event
(usually a temporal pattern of sound) is "modelled" by the motor
system.
<P>
<P>Note that this modelling process relies on a principle of
resemblance, by which some property abstracted from sound is
reproduced in motion; but these "resemblances" can be very
indirect and elaborate, and innovation and mimetic "wit" are
evident in more sophisticated human rhythmic games.  Thus the
modelling process is metaphoric, or holistic: many variants of
the basic rhythm may meet the criterion of resemblance, and the
rhythm itself is not easily reduced to digital or discrete units
combined according to "rules"; rather it is the Gestalt, or
overall pattern, that is primary.
<P>
<P>Human mimetic capacity extends to larger time-scales; it
extends to the purposive sequencing of larger chunks of body
movement over much longer periods of time.  The latter assumes an
extended mimetic imagination capable of imagining a series of
actions in environmental context.  If hominids could visually
track and "parse" a complex event, say as well as apes, then
given the location of the mimetic controller at the top end of
the event-perception system, they should have been able to re-
enact complex events once large-scale action-modelling was within
the capacity of the motor system.
<P>
(c) Sociocultural implications of mimetic action.  An improvement
in primate motor skill of this magnitude would inevitably have
resulted in changes to hominid patterns of social expression.
Existing repertoires of expressions would have become raw
material for this new motor-modelling mechanism.  By
"parachuting" a supramodal device like mimesis on top of the
primate motor hierarchy, previously stereotyped emotional
expressions would become rehearsable, refinable, and employable
in intentional communication.  This would allow a dramatic
increase in the variability of facial, vocal, and whole-body
expressions, as well as in the range of potential interactive
scenarios between pairs of individuals, or within larger groups
of hominids.  Importantly, since a supramodal mimetic capacity
would have extended to the existing vocal repertoire, it would
have increased selection pressure for the early improvement of
mimetic vocalization, a skill whose modern residue in speech is
known as prosody.
<P>
<P>Given a mechanism for intentional rehearsal and refinement,
constructional and instrumental skills would also have moved to
another plane of complexity through sharing and cultural
diffusion.  Improved toolmaking was in many ways the most notable
achievement of Homo erectus, but it is important to realize that
the manufacture of a new kind of tool implies a perceived need
for that tool, and corresponding advances in both tool use and
pedagogy.  Mimetic skill would have enabled widespread diffusion
of new applications, as well as supported the underlying praxic
innovations that led to new applications.
<P>
<P>In addition to toolmaking and emotional expression, motor
mimesis would have allowed some degree of quasi-symbolic
communication, in that it would have allowed hominids to create a
very simple shared semantic environment.  The "meaning" of mimed
versions of perceptual events is transparent to anyone possessing
the same event-perception capabilities as the actor; thus mimetic
representations can be shared, and constitute a cognitive
mechanism for creating unique communal sets of representations.
The shared expressive and social ramifications of mimetic
capacity thus follow with the same inevitability as improved
constructive skill.  As the whole body becomes a potential tool
for expression, a variety of new possibilities enter the social
arena: complex games, extended competition, pedagogy through
directed imitation (with a concomitant differentiation of social
roles), a subtler and more complex array of facial and vocal
expressions, and public action-metaphor, such as intentional
group displays of aggression, solidarity, joy, fear, and sorrow.
These would have perhaps constituted the first social "customs,"
and the basis of the first truly distinctive hominid cultures.
This kind of mimetically-transmitted custom still forms the
background social "theater" that supports and structures group
behavior in modern humans.
<P>
<P>Greater differentiation of social roles would also have been
enabled by mimetic skill.  The emergence of mimetic skill would
have amplified the existing range of differences between
individuals (and groups) in realms such as social manipulation,
fighting and physical dominance in general, toolmaking, tool use,
group bonding and loyalty, pedagogical skill, mating behavior and
emotional control.  This would have complicated social life,
placing increased memory demands on the individual; but these
communication tools would also have created a much-increased
capacity for social coordination, which was probably necessary
for a culture capable of moving a seasonal base camp or pursuing
a long hunt.
<P>
<P>It is important to consider the question of the durability
of a hominid society equipped with mimetic skill: adaptations
would not endure if they did not result in a stable survival
strategy for a species over the long run.  Mimesis would have
provided obvious benefits, allowing hominids to expand their
territory, extend their potential sources of food, and respond
more effectively as a group to dangers and threats.  But it may
also have introduced some destabilizing elements, especially by
amplifying both the opportunities for competition, and the
potential social rewards of competitive success, in hominid
culture.
<P>
(d) The dissociability of mimetic skill in modern humans.  The
neuropsychological dissociability of mimesis can be demonstrated
from neuropsychological studies of modern humans with brain
injury.  Certain paroxysmal aphasics manifest a unified, coherent
strategy for dealing with reality that has the properties of a
purely mimetic strategy.  Their cognitions have a style that is
often (I believe simplistically) termed a "right-hemisphere"
strategy, and it shows a degree of unity, and a complete
independence from language, that must be explained.
<P>
<P>One well-documented case (Lecours &amp; Joanette, 1980) suffered
from seizures lasting as long as ten or eleven hours, during
which all aspects of language--including inner speech--were
"excised" from his mind. Nevertheless, he remained fully
conscious, able to find his way around, able to operate an
elevator or a radio (he used the news station on the radio to
test whether he was regaining speech comprehension), and capable
of communicating with gesture and mime.  Most importantly, he
retained perfect episodic recall for most of these seizures; he
could remember what went on during the spell, including who
entered and left the room, and what he had done with his time.
This implies that neither his formation of retrievable episodic
memories, nor his subsequent retrieval of them, could have
depended upon having a functional language system at the time of
storage.  Nor could his functioning mimetic skills have depended
on language.  There are other neurological syndromes that produce
a somewhat similar profile--some cases of global aphasia, for
instance--but most patients suffer from other disabilities as
well as permanent impairments, and this makes clear distinctions
between language and nonlanguage symptoms difficult to derive.
The uniqueness of paroxysmal cases lies in their lack of
nonlanguage symptoms such as apraxia, agnosia, amnesia or
dementia, and their ability to return to normal after the
seizure.
<P>
<P>Further evidence comes from documented histories of deaf-
mute people raised in hearing communities without formal sign
language training.  Such individuals could have had none of the
lexical, syntactic or morphological features normally associated
with language.  They obviously lacked a sound-based lexicon of
words; they couldn't read or write, and had no access to a
community of other deaf individuals who signed, and thus also
lacked a visually-based lexicon.  Yet by some acounts (cf Lane,
1984) such individuals retained a capacity for all aspects of
what I have identified as mimetic cognition: a full range of
human emotional expressivity, gesture, mime, dance, athletic and
constructional skills, and an ability to participate in
reciprocal mimetic games.
<P>
<P>The persistence of mimetic skill is evident in modern
society.  In fact the realm of mimetic representation is still
relatively autonomous from that of language, and remains
essential to the training of those who work with the body, such
as actors or athletes, as well as to those who practise
traditional constructional skills, such as arts and crafts.  It
is central to human social effectiveness, and to the practise and
teaching of games, competitive skills, and many group expressive
customs, as for instance in the intentional use of group laughter
as punishment, or the signalling of deference, affection,
manliness, celebration, and grief; or the maintenance of group
solidarity (see, for instance Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1989; Argyle,
1975; Eckman, Sorenson &amp; Friesen, 1969)
<P>
(e) Mimesis as a preadaptation for language.  Mimetic skill was,
fortuitously, an important preadaptation for the later evolution
of language.  It allowed hominid tool technology and social
organization, and the shared realm of custom and expression to
become more complex.  Given the inherent fuzziness and ambiguity
of mimetic representation, it would eventually have reached a
level of complexity where a method of disambiguating intended
mimetic messages would have had immediate adaptive benefits.
Thus it created conditions which would have favored a
communication device of greater speed and power.
<P>
<P>But on a more fundamental level, the principle of self-
triggered voluntary retrieval of representations had to be
established in the brain before the highly complex motor acts of
speech would have been possible.  Phonetic skill has been called
"articulatory gesture" by various investigators (Brownman &amp;
Goldstein, 1989); the whole higher apparatus of speech depends on
the basically mimetic ability of individuals to create
rehearsable and retrievable vocal acts, usually in close
connection with other mimetic acts.  In a word, language per se
is layered on top of a mimetically-skilled phonological system.
<P>
<P>However language is not confined to the phonological system,
because mimesis is inherently supramodal; thus when phonology
malfunctions, other mimetic subsystems may be harnessed by the
language system.  This is particularly visible in Petitto &amp;
Marentette's (1991) elegant documentation of infant babbling in
sign-language environments, which occurs at exactly the same time
as phonological babbling, and has the same properties.  Deaf
infants, growing up in deaf-signing households, showed themselves
to be very good at miming the motor principle behind signing, if
not the signs themselves; that is, their manual "babbling"
reflected the conditional probabilities of their expressive
environments on a purely mimetic level.  This is exactly what
babbling infants do in hearing households: they model, in their
actions, one of the most obvious dimensions of motor behavior to
be observed in their families: repetitive, and to the infant,
apparently random, production of phonological acts.
<P>
<P>Babbling, whether oral or manual, is reference-free in the
linguistic sense--that is, it has no linguistic meaning--but it
is nevertheless truly representational, in that babbling patterns
are (eventually) excellent motor-models of the expressive
patterns the infants observe around them.  They reproduce not
only the elementary units of language, but also the larger
mimetic envelope of expression as well: for instance prosody, and
the habit of alternation, or "waiting one's turn" in expressive
exchanges.  Since babbling is free of linguistic reference, the
brain mechanism that supports it does not have to be linked to
language per se; rather, these eight to ten-month old infants
look very much like good supramodal mime artists.  And the
supramodal nature of their babbling is very revealing: the fact
that babbling isn't confined to phonology suggests that a
supramodal mimetic adaptation evolved first, with phonology
developing later, as a specialized subsystem of mimetic capacity.
<P>
<P>There are other theories that view early advances in praxic
skill as preadaptations for language (Kimura, 1976; Corballis &amp;
Beale, 1976).  Kimura observed that oral and manual apraxia and
aphasia often result from the same left-sided lesions; from this
she inferred that language and voluntary movement control are
linked, possibly to a common processor.  However, the
neuropsychological case for linking pantomime and language to the
same left-sided serial processor has since disintegrated (see
Poizner, Klima &amp; Bellugi, 1987; also Square-Storer, Roy, & Hogg
1990).
<P>
<P>These authors did not provide any theoretical justification
of why praxis should have been an essential preadaptation for
language, but Corballis's more recent (1989, 1991) hypothesis
faces this problem squarely.  His idea is that the left
hemisphere acquired a general-purpose capacity for "generativity"
that served as the common substrate for image generation and
praxis, and later for language.  Generativity requires
categorical perception, or the decomposition of the object-world
into elementary units; and it also requires the ability to
recombine these units, as in both phonology and image-generation
(Kosslyn, 1988).  In Corballis's view, these two aspects of
generativity evolved for improved praxis, forming a preadaptation
for the later emergence of language.  A closely related theory
has been proposed by Greenfield (1991), who argues for a common
left-sided mechanism for combinatory praxis and phonology, at a
prelinguistic level.
<P>
<P>The concept of mimetic skill proposed here differs
fundamentally from both Corballis's idea of generativity, and
Greenfield's left-sided praxic "module" in its reduced emphasis
on cerebral laterality; as pointed out at some length in my book,
mimetic skill is probably bilateral (which is not to say that it
is symmetrical) in distribution.  More importantly, it differs in
the nature of the proposed underlying mechanism.  Generative
praxis is conceived of as categorical, rule-governed and serial
in its manner of operation, while mimesis is basically a holistic
or analog system that can model over time as well as space.  A
capacity for serially recombining categorical units would not
easily account for the complex, fuzzy, holistic process of
comparing movements against their idealized versions (cf Moerck,
1989), or of producing event-reenactments, as in charades or
pantomime.  The generative modelling of the mimetic action-
patterns that humans create and refine (including phonology)
seems far too metaphorical and analog in principle to fit easily
into this kind of quasi-symbolic computational framework.
<P>
Second transition: lexical invention
<P>
<P>The rationale for the second transition is briefly as
follows: (a) since no linguistic environment yet existed, a move
towards language would have depended primarily on developing a
capacity for lexical invention; (b) phonological evolution was
accelerated by the emergence of this general capacity for lexical
invention, and included a whole complex of special neuronal and
anatomical modifications for speech; (c) the language system
evolved as an extension of lexical skill, and gradually extended
to the labelling of relationships between words, and also to the
imposition of more and more complex metalinguistic skills that
govern the uses of words; and (d) the natural collective product
of language was narrative thought, (essentially, storytelling)
which evolved for specific social purposes, and serves
essentially similar purposes in modern society.
<P>
(a) Lexical invention.  Lexical invention is not yet understood
in terms of mechanism.  There is no viable computational model of
this process, and neuronal network models have not yet reached
the point where anything so complex could be simulated.  The
process mapping the "lemma" or meaning-based side of the lexicon
onto the form of the symbol--whether it is phonological or
manual--involves much more than the association of a discrete
signifier, or form, with a discrete meaning.  The previous
section argues that phonology, like any mimetic system, works
according to a metaphorical principle; but so does lexical
invention, if Wittgenstein (1922) or Johnson-Laird (1983) are to
be believed.  In other words, both word-forms and meanings tend
to be fuzzy, and neither side in the lexical entry is cleanly
defined or discrete.  Nevertheless, the tension between word-form
and meaning is a creative one that greatly increases the range of
things that can be represented.
<P>
<P>As discussed at some length in the book, the invention of a
symbol is a complex process that involves labelling and
differentiating our perceptions and conceptions of the world,
including other symbols as parts of that world.  Form is mapped
onto meaning, but meaning is defined by that same process, in a
reciprocal tension.  This reciprocal tension is evident even now,
after at least 45,000 years of lexical invention.  Languages are
constantly changing their particular mappings of form onto
meaning; for instance all of the tremendously diverse aboriginal
American languages derived from three root Asiatic languages
within past 15,000 years (Greenberg &amp; Ruhlen, 1992); and the
entire Indo-European group of languages, including language-
groups as diverse as Sanskrit, Gaelic, Latin, and Greek, have all
evolved from a common ancestor within the past 7,000 years
(Renfrew, 1989).  This incessant pattern of change suggests that
the driving force behind lexical invention--the need to define
and redefine our maps of meaning onto word forms--is more
fundamental and considerably less rigid than the specific forms
and rules of language at any given moment.
<P>
(b) The phonological adaptation.  Phonology was not the primary
language adaptation, but rather a specialized mimetic subsystem
that supported the primary adaptation, lexical invention.  The
specialized anatomical subsystem that supports phonology evolved
after the evolution of a supramodal lexical capacity, or more
properly perhaps, concurrently with it, in a mutually reinforcing
manner.  As a mimetic subsystem, phonology has the same basic
properties as all mimetic action, such as rehearsability,
autocueing, and purposive refinement.  The fact that language can
be off-loaded to other motor modalities, as it is in the sign
languages of the deaf, is evidence of the secondary position of
phonology in the evolutionary chronology.  Phonology in itself
could not have created a lexicon, and without lexical invention
it is doubtful whether humans would have been subjected to
selection pressures favoring such a powerful phonological system.
<P>
<P>Nevertheless it was a very complex and important adaptation,
and without it, archaic sapient humans may not have been able to
sustain the expansion of lexical capacity that they subsequently
did.  The great survival value of phonology to archaic humans is
evident in the fact that it evolved despite the great respiratory
dangers associated with a descended larynx, and in the sheer
anatomical complexity of the adaptation.  Included in the
phonological adaptation were (as a minimum): the descent of the
human larynx and the redesign of the supralaryngeal vocal tract,
with corresponding central motor programming devices; a
specialized auditory device for achieving improved auditory
object constancy, which feeds back directly onto speech
production; the articulatory loop, for immediate literal recall
of articulated messages; and a specialized, large-capacity
auditory memory system for word-forms (see Lieberman, 1975, 1984;
Levelt, 1989).
<P>
<P>The importance of phonology should not be underestimated.
There is little alternative to the notion that the original form
of language is spoken language.  There is an easy relationship
between vocalizing and language, perhaps because phonology is
fast, highly portable, and less likely to interfere with
locomotion or praxis: in this sense it is a special "channel" of
communication that can float freely above the largely visuomotor
world of events, constructing commentaries unimpeded.  Moreover
it works at a distance and in the dark, two features that have
great adaptive value.
<P>
<P>Phonology also has the special virtue of being able to
generate a virtually infinite number of easily retrievable sound-
patterns for symbolic use.  Human retrieval capacity for oral
words is extraordinary; we carry around tens of thousands, and in
the case of some multilinguals, hundreds of thousands, of words;
most other species, from bees to the Great Apes, seem to be
limited to a few dozen expressions at most in the wild; and this
limitation even applies to Cheney &amp; Seyfarth's (1990) vervet
monkeys.
<P>
<P>The natural dominance of phonology over manual signing is
evident in experimental settings where subjects are encouraged to
tell stories about specific experiences, and videotaped for
gesture.  In such experiments (cf McNeill, 1985) facial and
manual gesture fall into a secondary support role, their timing
ruled to the millisecond by spoken words; even the mimetic
dimension of voice, prosody, remains secondary to the expressed
meaning.  Phonology is thus clearly the medium of choice for
language itself.  However it should be added that this pattern of
dominance is often broken, especially in humor (including the
humor of children), where the semantic counterpoint between what
is said, and what is gestured or done, can become a powerful
means of expression in itself.  The ease with which humans can
parallel- process two contradictory messages--mimetic and
linguistic--has been long known to playwrights.
<P>
<P>Importantly, these new representational acts, speech and
mimesis, can both be performed covertly as well as overtly.
Covert speech has been called "inner speech" by Baddeley (1986),
who considers it to be equivalent to the activation of the
central aspects of articulation, without actual motor execution.
The mental operation we call "imagination" can similarly be seen
as mimesis without motor execution of the imagined acts.  The
control of mimetic imagination (probably even of visual
generative imagery, which is facilitated by imagined self-
movement) presumably lies in a special form of kinematic imagery.
Auto-retrievability is just as crucial for covert imaginative or
linguistic thought as it is for the overt, or acted-out
equivalent.  Thus, given a lexicon, the human mind became able to
self-trigger recall from memory in two ways: by means of mimetic
imagination, and by the use of word-symbols,  either of which
could be overt or covert.
<P>
(c) Grammar and metalinguistic skill.  I have opted for a
lexically-driven, rather diffuse model of language evolution
partly because it fits in well with the preceding evolutionary
scenario, and partly because I judge this to be a scientific
"best bet" on the basis of an extensive review of neurolinguistic
research.  The main issue here is whether grammar, and
metalinguistic skills such as those which operate at the level of
discourse and logic, require a separate adaptation in addition to
phonology and lexical invention.  If one were to try to envisage
language in such a way as to meet all of Fodor's (1983)
requirements for a true linguistic "module," a separate grammar
module would surely fail on a number of counts (as Fodor has
acknowledged) especially inasmuch as it appears to be completely
interpenetrable with the rest of language, and closely tied to
semantics.
<P>
<P>Moreover the neurological case for a separate grammar module
is weakened by recent cross-linguistic studies of aphasia, which
strongly suggest that there is no specific brain lesion, nor any
specific pattern of grammatical deficit, that is universally
found in agrammatics of all languages.  According to the
"competition" model proposed by Bates &amp; MacWhinney (1987), the
whole perisylvian region of the left hemisphere is diffusely
dedicated to language, function words and grammatical rules being
stored in the same tissue as other kinds and aspects of lexical
entries.  However, I readily admit that this issue, like many
others in this field, is still not conclusively resolved; there
is electrophysiological evidence that function words--those most
relevant to grammar--might have a different cerebral
representation from open-class words (Neville, 1992).
<P>
<P>A related issue is whether it seems necessary a priori to
posit a separate adaptation for the invention and transmission of
grammar and the metalinguistic skills that support extended
discourse.  I have cited some biographical accounts of symbolic
invention in mathematics as examples of how difficult it is to
invent any new word or symbol.  Once a concept has been
"captured" lexically for the first time, it seems to become much
easier to transmit it to others, but its original invention is
generally difficult; and every new invention must then be
subjected to the shared linguistic market for acceptance or
rejection.  All original lexical invention is difficult and
collective.  This applies to all classes of words, and there is
no compelling reason why closed-class, or function words might
not be viewed as a product of the same skill that enabled the
invention of nouns and adjectives.  If the lexical inventor can
isolate and define an abstract concept like "run" (including the
exclusion rules for its correct use) it is not clear why that
same mind could not isolate and define a function word like
"with."  Grammatical concepts do not seem to demand special
treatment in their invention, and presumably, transmission.
<P>
<P>Certainly, it would make good evolutionary sense to
attribute language to one core adaptation whose further evolution
could account for all the attributes of language and language-
based thought.  Part of the reason is, simply, time; there wasn't
enough time in the human story for more radical cognitive
adaptations, and a capacity lexical invention is the obvious sine
qua non of language, and hence must be put first.  If we put
lexical invention earlier in the scenario, as Bickerton (1990)
did, then there might have been time for a separate adaptation
for grammar; but then we must explain why a powerful capacity
like lexical invention would have evolved when it was apparently
not needed 1.5 million years ago, and then failed to develop
further for over a million years.  If we put lexical invention
late, as I and many others do, there doesn't seem to be enough
time to allow for a second adaptation for grammar.
<P>
(d) Sociocultural ramifications.  Spoken language increased the
number and complexity of available words and grammars, and
altered human culture by introducing a new level of shared
representation.  My hypothesis is that mimetic skill continued
(and continues) to serve its traditional social purposes
perfectly well: it still provides the cognitive foundation for
institutions like dance, athletics, craft, ritual, and theatre.
Oral language initially carved out its own sphere of influence
within mimetic culture, eventually assuming a dominant and
governing role in human culture, but never eliminating our basic
dependence on mimetic expression.  Oral language remains focussed
on the human world, particularly on relationships (Dunbar, 1993)
and this pattern extends to a wide range of cultures, from
technologically primitive hunters and gatherers, to highly
urbanized modern European societies.
<P>
<P>The natural product of language is narrative thought; in
this sense language, like mimesis, evolved primarily as a method
of modelling reality.  Dunbar (1993) has argued that the normal
social use of language is storytelling about other people--
gossip--and has produced observational data to prove this.  But
day-to-day storytelling in a shared oral culture eventually
produces collective, standardized narrative versions of reality,
particularly of past events; and these become what we call the
dominant "myths" of a society.  It is interesting that all
documented human societies, even the most technologically
primitive, have elaborate systems of myth, which appears to
reflect the earliest form of integrative thought.  These socially
pervasive constructs continue to exert a major influence on the
way oral societies--and indeed most modern societies--are run:
thus I have suggested that many cultures might be labelled
"mythic," after their governing representations.
<P>
Third transition: the externalization of memory
<P>
<P>The case for a third cognitive transition is based on
arguments, partly structural, and partly chronological, that are
similar in principle to those used for the first two; but the
physical factors that supported the third transition are a little
different, inasmuch as the latter was driven primarily by
technological, rather than biological developments.  The
chronological evidence is based on the rapid emergence of whole
new classes of memory representations--external memory records--
as well as a major change in the types of symbolic artifacts
produced by humans.  The structural argument is based partly on
neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence bearing on
localization and plasticity, and partly on an analysis of
cognitive architecture in the context of our new relationship
with external memory.
<P>
<P>The historical case for a third transition rests on evidence
that since the Upper Paleolithic, humans have gradually developed
three new representational devices.  The first was visuosymbolic
invention, which advanced through various well-documented stages,
culminating in a variety of complex graphic and numerical
conventions, and writing systems.  The second was external
memory, which evolved to the point where external memory records,
mediated by a "literate" class, started to play a governing role.
The third was the emergence of vary large externally-nested
cultural products called theories.  I will not reiterate the
voluminous historical evidence for this, partly for reasons of
space, but mostly because my chronology is neither original nor
in dispute.  The real argument for grouping together these
historical trends into a so-called "third transition" is a
structural one.
<P>
<P>The structural case can be stated as follows: (a) external
memory has introduced radical new properties into the collective
storage and retrieval systems of humans; (b) the use of these
external storage systems is difficult, and requires a major re-
deployment of cerebral resources towards establishing literacy-
related "modules" in the brain; (c) the physiological basis for
this reorganization probably lies in neuronal epigenesis and
plasticity; and (d) the role of biological working memory has
been changed by the heavy use of external memory.
<P>
(a) New properties.  Early humans, like their primate
predecessors, depended heavily on their natural or biological
memory capacities.  Even though mimetic skill and language
enabled humans to create a shared representational culture, the
actual physical storage of that collective knowledge depended on
individual memory.  Thought was dependent on biological working
memory, and whatever was seen or heard had to be remembered and
rehearsed either in imagination or in speech.  The contents of
our long-term store were accessible only by means of the limited
associative strategies available to biological memory, such as
similarity and contiguity; thus the need for oral mnemonics,
extensive literal oral recitation, and a dependence on
specialized individuals, like shamans, to preserve particularly
important memory material.
<P>
<P>The advantages of external memory are easily documented.
External symbolic storage systems allow humans to circumvent, at
least partially, the limitations of biological working memory,
while creating a wide range of new storage, retrieval and
processing possibilities.  By changing the physical medium of
storage, human memory systems have acquired new properties,
especially retrieval properties.  I have suggested the term
"exogram" to complement the notion of a biological "engram." As
shown in Table 1, exograms introduced new possibilities into the
human representational universe.
<P>
<P>Exographic storage constitutes a hardware change just as
real as the biological hardware changes that mediated the first
two transitions; and its effect on overall memory structure may
have been even greater.  The exportation of memory storage has
literally meant that the human race, as a collectivity, can now
evolve new memory systems at the accelerated rate of
technological change, as opposed to the relatively slow rate of
genetic change.  Perhaps the most important new features
introduced by external storage are radically different options in
memory retrieval, and the fact that exograms are easily
reformattable.  Extensive reformatting can modify the kinds of
ideas and images that are available to store in biological
memory, and so on, in iterative loops.  This iterative crafting
of complex memory records has produced completely new types of
symbolic representations that had no equivalents in preliterate
oral cultures--examples might include the servicing manuals for a
rocket engine, the equations proving the Pythagorean theorem, a
corporate income tax handbook, a heat-map of the troposphere, or
the libretto and score for Eugene Onegin.
<P>
(b) Cognitive reorganization.  External memory has introduced new
cognitive skill-clusters that are generally referred to as
"literacy" skills, but full symbolic literacy extends well beyond
the traditional Western definition of literacy, that is,
alphabetic reading competence.  The neuropsychology of various
acquired dyslexias, dysgraphias, and acalculias has revealed a
cluster of functionally dissociable cognitive "modules" in the
brain that are necessary to support these skills (see for
instance, Morton, 1984; Shallice, 1988; and Shallice &amp;
Warrington,1980).
<P>
<P>The localization of these neural modules seems to vary
across individuals, as might be expected since the whole
structure must have been imposed by cultural programming rather
than by any specific genetic predisposition built into the
nervous system.  There is a great deal of evidence in single-case
neurological histories that these "literacy support networks" are
anatomically and functionally distinct from those that support
oral-linguistic skills, as well as from those brain regions that
support basic perceptual and motor functions (see especially
Shallice, 1988).
<P>
<P>There are at least three dissociable high-level visual
interpretative paths involved in symbolic literacy.  The most
basic is "pictorial," and is needed to interpret pictorial
symbols such as pictograms and visual metaphors; even at this
level there are numerous interpretative (mostly metaphoric)
conventions to master.  The second is "ideographic," and is
sometimes called the direct visual-semantic path in studies of
reading (see Coltheart, Patterson &amp; Marshall, 1980; Paradis,
Hagiwara &amp; Hildebrandt, 1985); it maps visual symbols directly
onto ideas, as in the case of Chinese ideographic writing, most
systems of counting, or many street signs and analog graphic
devices like maps, histograms and charts.  The third is
"phonetic," and serves to map graphemes onto phonemes, as in
alphabetic print.  These three paths emerged at different
historical phases of visuosymbolic evolution, and remain
functionally independent of one another; moreover, each path
feeds into a distinct visual "lexicon" of thousands of
recognizable symbols.
<P>
(c) Physical basis.  How could the highly complex functional
subsystems necessary for reading, writing and other visuosymbolic
processing skills be accommodated by the human brain without
genetic change?  The answer seems to lie in the increased
neocortical plasticity that came with the final expansion of the
human brain.  This increase in plasticity might be partly a
function of greater cortical asymmetry, which allows non-
redundancies of function between homologous association regions
in the two hemispheres, in effect creating twice as much "extra"
neuronal space as a comparable expansion in primary cortical
regions, which tend to be more symmetrical in function.  Morover,
the immense tertiary neo-neocortical subregions of the human
brain have so many competing input pathways that epigenetic
factors such as those described by Changeux (1985) and Edelman
(1987) could create a very great range of potential functional
arrangements.  In effect, it is probably because of the
plasticity of this arrangement that the human brain can invest so
heavily in the decoding baggage needed for using large numbers of
novel external memory devices.
<P>
<P>In addition, there is evidence that even in adults the
cerebral cortex is constantly re-adjusting and fine-tuning its
assignment of processing space, reflecting the constantly
changing use-patterns imposed by the environment.  The
somatosensory regions of neocortex may be reorganized by a
prolonged increase in stimulation; in fact the area dedicated to
fine touch discrimination expands and contracts in response to
imposed load changes (see, for instance, Merzenich, Nelson, Kaas,
Stryker, Jenkins, Zook, Cynader &amp; Schopana, 1987).  This
sensitivity to use-pattern may even extend to functions quite
different from those that normally occupy a given region, as in
the case of the auditory cortex of a congenitally deaf person,
which in the absence of auditory stimulation will eventually
assume visual functions (Neville, 1990).  If the relatively hard-
wired primary sensory regions are this flexible, then tertiary
cortical regions ought to show even greater flexibility in their
function, given the additional degrees of freedom added by moving
two synapses or more from the many sensory, motor and association
regions that impinge upon them.
<P>
<P>There appear to be tradeoffs inherent in this flexible
arrangement--that is, "invasions" of a given region by an
environmentally or culturally driven function will displace other
functions that may potentially have depended on that region.
This suggests that high levels of literacy skill may entail
considerable costs, as indeed has been suggested by the
literature comparing the cognitive competencies of oral cultures
with those of literate ones.  Oral memory and visual imagery are
often listed among the skills that may have been traded off
against literacy (Richardson,1969; Cole, Gay, Glick &amp; Sharp,
1971).
<P>
(d) Changed role of biological memory.  One of the most
interesting effects of external memory devices is the way in
which they alter human working memory.  Working memory is
generally conceived of as a system centered on consciousness: and
although there are many alternatives in the literature,
Baddeley's (1986) model was adopted for the purposes of this
discussion because it is fairly representative and maps very well
onto a neurobiological model.  The tripartite working memory
structure proposed by Baddeley includes two slave memory systems,
the articulatory loop and the visual-spatial sketchpad, and a
central executive.  According to this model, when we think, we
either imagine, via the sketchpad, or verbalize, via the
articulatory loop (the latter may be covert, in the form of
"inner speech").  The central executive handles the intermediate-
term semantic context--for instance in a conversation it might
keep track of what was said, by whom, and in what context.  This
working memory structure provides the basis for consciousness,
although not everything held in working memory is consciously
experienced; rather, it is easily available to consciousness.
<P>
<P>In preliterate cultures this arrangement, or something close
to it, was all humans had to work with, and its limitations are
well documented.  A society that relies on this type of memory
mechanism would accordingly have to depend upon a variety of
social arrangements and mnemonic skills to maintain its
accumulating knowledge-base: rote verbal recitation, preferably
in groups; specialized individuals whose task was to learn and
retain knowledge (for instance, shamans and bards); formulaic
recital by individuals in an undisturbed, special place; rigidly-
formal and repetitive group ritual; and various forms of visual
imagination as a means of understanding and retaining quite
complex memories.
<P>
<P>This situation has changed with the increased use of
external symbolic storage.  The larger architecture within which
the individual mind works has changed; in fact, the structure of
internal memory is now reflected in the external environment:
there is now an external memory field that serves as the real
"working memory" for many mental operations, and there is also an
external "long-term" store.  The  external equivalent of the
long-term store has very different storage and retrieval
properties from those of our internal long-term store.
Similarly, the external working memory field has completely
different properties from the internal working memory system.
Whenever an individual is "plugged in" to some part of the
external store, that interaction is mediated by certain items
displayed in the external memory field; the latter may consist of
a variety of display devices, including print, graphs, monitors,
and so on, usually arranged in visual space.  The conscious mind
is thus juxtaposed between two memory structures, one internal
and the other external.
<P>
<P>The external display projects directly to the visual
regions, which now become the locus of a new kind of internal
working memory, one which utilizes the power of the perceptual
systems.  In effect, because the perceptual systems are
displaying representations (as opposed to nonsymbolic objects),
the user's brain can move through "information space" just as it
has always moved through the natural environment, with the
difference that processing occurs on two levels, instead of only
one.  The items displayed in the external memory field are
treated first as natural objects and events, and second as memory
representations that can externally program the user's brain,
that is, create specific states of knowledge that were intended
by the creator of the particular external device on display.
<P>
<P>This second level of analysis, which is the prerequisite for
literacy, imposes a great load on visual as well as semantic
processing.  The process of reading a book, where meanings
literally pop out of the script (or the graphs, numbers,
ideograms, and/or other types of symbols it employs) requires a
tremendous amount of additional high-level processing.  This
second level of processing, wholly automated in the expert
reader, requires rapid access to thousands of internally stored
pictorial, ideographic, graphemic, and visual-lexical codes,
along with various specialized grammars, scanning conventions,
and a great deal of interpretative knowledge.  In effect, this
second-level visual system produces knowledge-states that are
directly driven from the external memory field; it thus becomes
the internal display device for a very complex external memory
trace.  The literate brain thus becomes externally programmable.
<P>
<P>But unlike the constantly-moving and fading contents of
biological working memory, the contents of this externally-driven
processor can be frozen in time, reviewed, refined, and
reformatted.  Moreover, all of this can be done intentionally,
on-line, and in real time, in constant interaction with the
external display mechanism.  In biological working memory, the
possibility of this kind of iterative refinement of mental
representations is very limited.  Neither of Baddeley's (1986)
slave systems can support such reflection: the articulatory loop
needs constant rehearsal and has a decay-time of a few seconds,
while the visual sketchpad is even more ephemeral, vaguely-
defined and vulnerable to interference.  The central executive is
able to hold quite a large amount of information, but in order to
consciously modify that information, its contents apparently need
to be displayed in one of the slave systems, usually in a covert
manner (for instance, inner speech).  This imposes a serious
limitation on the amount of conscious reflection that can be done
on any material that is stored exclusively in biological working
memory.
<P>
<P>Breaking out of this limited working memory arrangement in
itself was a very major change.  But it potentiated another
important new development: new metalinguistic skills, which
expressed themselves in the kinds of symbolic products and
cognitive artifacts (Norman, 1990) humans could produce and
maintain.  Producing a single new entry in the external storage
system is not a trivial occupation, and it never has been, from
Ice Age cave-paintings to modern science.  As artifacts have
become much more complex, and the knowledge environment itself
has grown, the specific skills needed to become a serious
"player" have also taken much more specific preparation, in the
form of extended apprenticeships and higher education.  There is
a trend in the kinds of "metalinguistic" thought-skills that have
been taught in Western academies over the past few thousand
years, moving from an early emphasis on oral and narrative
skills, towards visuosymbolic and paradigmatic skills.  Denny
(1991) has suggested that the major new thought pattern
attributable to literacy is a property called
"decontextualization," and Olson (1991) has suggested that
writing allowed the "objectification" of language, and
consequently the development of formal thought skills.  These
proposals are compatible with my suggestion that literacy allowed
the thought process itself to be subjected to iterative
refinement through its stable display in the external memory
field, and its subsequent incremental refinement, like any other
external symbolic product.
<P>
<P>The modern brain must accommodate not only these new working
memory arrangements, and all the coding demands imposed by
symbolic literacy, but also a number of metalinguistic skills
that simply did not exist a few thousands of years ago.  The
latter are socially-entrenched; for instance an enterprise like
modern science is very much a collective endeavor, in which the
individual mind is essentially a node in a larger newtworked
structure supported by external memory.  Humans have been part of
a collective knowledge enterprise ever since mimetic skill
permitted us to break with the limitations of episodic cognition,
but external memory has amplified the number and variety of
representations available in human culture, and increased the
degree to which our minds share representations and rely on
external devices for the process of thought itself. Cognitive
studies of the modern workplace (for instance Hutchins, 1985;
Suchman, 1987; and Olson &amp; Olson, 1991) testify to the way that
electronically distributed knowledge representation, and
computer-coordinated planning and problem-solving, are affecting
the relative roles of individual minds and external memory
devices in this collective enterprise.
