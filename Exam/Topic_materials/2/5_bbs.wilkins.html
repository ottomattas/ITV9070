<H2>Abstract</H2>
This target article presents a plausible evolutionary
scenario for the emergence of the neural preconditions for language
in the hominid lineage. In pleistocene primate lineages there was a
paired evolutionary expansion of frontal and parietal neocortex
(through certain well-documented adaptive changes associated with
manipulative behaviors) resulting, in ancestral hominids, in an
incipient Broca's region and in a configurationally unique junction
of the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes of the brain (the
POT). On our view, the development of the POT in our ancestors
resulted in the neuroanatomical substrate consistent with the
ability for representations in modality-neutral association cortex
and, as a result of structure-imposing interaction with Broca's
area, the hierarchically structured "conceptual structure." Evidence
from paleoneurology and comparative primate neuroanatomy is used to
argue that Homo habilis (2.5-2 million years ago) was the first
hominid to have the appropriate gross neuroanatomical configuration
to support conceptual structure. We thus suggest that the neural
preconditions for language are met in H. habilis. Finally, we
advocate a theory of language acquisition that uses conceptual
structure as input to the learning procedures, thus bridging the
gap between it and language.

1.  Introduction
<P>It is common among linguists to assume that language is a
species-specific, biologically determined characteristic of
humans.  Most are comfortable with the claim that certain areas
of the human brain are devoted to the various language-related
tasks.  In spite of this acceptance of the biological basis of
language, it is rare for cognitive scientists to address the
question of its evolutionary emergence.  Given the evidence that
language is a species-specific characteristic, it would seem
natural to ask how that characteristic arose in the species.  But
for contemporary linguistics and cognitive science this would
appear to be a distinctly unnatural question, at least judging
=66rom the paucity of attention paid to the matter.  Most
researchers currently working on language have preferred to avoid
the issue of its possible evolutionary origins, at least in
public fora.  The reasons for avoiding the issue are many, some
the result of historical precedent, others because of the
inherent difficulty in studying the evolutionary emergence of any
cognitive capacity.
<P>It is our purpose with this article, through the suggestion
of a plausible evolutionary scenario, to spark more interest
among linguists and other cognitive scientists in the question of
the emergence of language in the human species.  While admittedly
not conclusive, what follows will suggest directions for
discussion, weaving together threads provided by paleoneurology,
comparative neuroanatomy, and evolutionary theory, as well as
linguistic theory.  The origins and evolution of language
capacity can and should be discussed scientifically and, further,
should become an area of serious investigation within the field
of cognitive neuroscience.  We have for too long considered the
origin of the linguistic capacity a mystery; it is time to treat
it as a problem amenable to serious intellectual inquiry.
<P>In speculations on possible evolutionary precursors to
language, the issue necessarily arises as to the nature or
usefulness of a partially evolved linguistic system.  Ancestral
cognitive capacities can only be inferred from physical evidence,
and written evidence of language is too recent historically to be
of evolutionary value.  Linguists have generally assumed (at
least implicitly) that either a system is a language or it is
not, and have largely avoided speculation on the nature of a
partially-evolved linguistic capacity.
<P>Despite the lack of evidence for intermediate stages in
linguistic evolution, the alternatives are hard to accept.  If
some species-specific characteristic did not evolve in piecemeal
fashion, then there would seem to be only two ways to explain its
appearance.  Either it was put in place by some still-
undiscovered force, perhaps through divine intervention, or it
was the result of some relatively abrupt change in the
development of the species, perhaps some sort of spontaneous and
widespread mutation.  For very different reasons, either of these
alternatives is hard to accept.  Most linguists prefer to address
language from a scientific rather than theological perspective,
and would not invoke unexplainable forces to account for the
emergence of language.  A few might find the mutation suggestion
feasible, but the fortuitous nature of such a happenstance
mutation makes that explanation seem suspect.  As has been
pointed out (Pinker and Bloom, 1990), the chances against a
mutation resulting in a system as complex and apparently so
ideally suited to its task as is language are staggeringly high.
<P>Our approach to the emergence of linguistic capacity is
based on two important tenets.  First, as noted above, it would
seem hard to accept either that language evolved gradually or
that it emerged abruptly, fully developed.  On the theory being
presented here, we argue that the gradualist/abruptist issue is,
in fact, a non-issue; the apparent conundrum can be resolved by
reference to the biological basis of language, separating the
question of the evolution of the primate brain from the question
of the evolution of human language.  The appropriate brain
structures evolved gradually, under pressures of natural
selection, by the mechanisms typically subsumed under Darwinian
theory.  Language was made possible, however, only at the moment
that the brain achieved the appropriate internal configuration.
We suggest that the most convincing evidence points to a "moment"
approximately 2 million years ago at which time Homo habilis
appeared in the fossil record.
<P>Second, we take very seriously the distinction between
language (as a formal grammatical system), on the one hand, and
communicative abilities and devices, on the other.  It is
important to our argument that the ability to communicate be
treated separately from the possession of a language faculty and,
further, that linguistic ability be distinguished from any other
(modular) cognitive capacity.  We do not argue that the ability
to communicate arose with Homo habilis, but rather that the basic
neurolinguistic capacity for language acquisition did.
Additionally, we clearly distinguish linguistic competence from
speech.  Other researchers who have recently turned their
attention to questions of evolution do not necessarily
distinguish between language and communication, and further,
often take evidence of vocal speech to be the primary indicator
of language (several articles in Wind et al., 1992, are typical
in this regard, e.g. Wind; Braitenberg and Sch=81z; Falk; Newman;
Laitman, Reidenberg, and Gannon; Lieberman).  Even linguists who
otherwise might embrace a formalist approach to language, when
they turn to questions of evolution, motivate a history of
linguistic development largely from arguments regarding pressures
for an enhanced communicative repertoire (see, for example,
Lamendella, 1976; Lieberman, 1984, 1985, 1989; Brandon and
Hornstein, 1986; Hurford, 1989; Pinker and Bloom, 1990).  We
dissociate the emergence of linguistic capacity from the
evolution of communicative abilities.
<P>Finally, we comment on the relationship between the
emergence of language in the species and the acquisition of
language by the individual human language-learner.  We suggest
that, given the appropriate neural foundations, the situations
for the early Pleistocene H. habilis child and the 20th century
child faced with the task of language acquisition are not wholly
dissimilar; the most substantial difference is in the nature of
the input to the learner.  Certain illuminating parallels might
be drawn in this regard, in fact, between the degraded input to
the modern-day deaf child raised in an oralist environment and
that available to the first generation of language-capable
humans.
2.  Adaptation and evolutionary reappropriation
<P>When we think of evolution, what comes to mind most readily
is some version of gradual adaptation shaped by forces of natural
selection, i.e. that process whereby those individuals of a
species that have certain (genetically transmittable) traits that
make them better able to respond to environmental pressures
survive and reproduce in greater numbers.  Eventually the
naturally selected trait becomes characteristic of the species,
appearing predictably in later generations.  By adaptation
through the mechanism of natural selection, species become more
suited to their environment and prosper.
<P>It might seem obvious, when we think of modern humans, that
language is an adaptive trait, one that makes us more able to
survive in our environment.  It would then seem equally obvious
that, ceteris paribus, survival would be enhanced by linguistic
capacity (see especially Pinker and Bloom, 1990).  But direct
selection for an adaptive capacity is not the only evolutionary
process conducive to the emergence of structural or behavioral
innovation; a structure may arise through adaptively selective
mechanisms and, by its conformation alone, be neutrally
preadaptive (Darwin, 1871) or exploitable for some function
independent of the original function.  It may, in fact, produce a
new capacity not already in the repertoire of the organism.  This
manner of exploitation converts the raw material provided by
adaptation (or by the laws of growth and form) to a function
which may itself prove beneficial to the organism or taxon.
Darwin's term for this is preadaptation.  Because this term has
developed an unintended, premeditative connotation, we wish to
avoid it and instead will refer to this phenomenon as
evolutionary reappropriation.  By the term "reappropriation", we
mean specifically to highlight the means by which a structure or
function in the repertoire of a species reaches an evolutionary
state that is compatible with, and facilitates, a new function.
This new function may or may not be behaviorally related to the
original.  The secondary function via its underlying structure
may itself then be operated upon, and refined, by natural
selection and, additionally, may "set in motion selection for
changes in other structures" (Futuyma, 1986, p. 424).  It is
precisely this sort of preadaptationist view that Darwin favored
with respect to the origins of higher cognitive capacities in
human evolution (Sober, 1984,p. 24; cf. Darwin, 1871).
<P>The neuroanatomical structures that underlie linguistic
ability, we will argue, arose in human taxa as a direct result of
evolutionary reappropriation (also see Calvin, 1992).  They
evolved to the state at which they were available for incipient
linguistic capacity to emerge by gradual, adaptive changes in
brain organization that were the result, in the hominid line, of
natural selection for other behaviors that require specific,
highly sophisticated neural processing mechanisms.  These
neuroanatomical structures were not, however, adaptations
originally serving communicative functions.  Our investigation of
the origins of language concerns itself specifically with the
reappropriative basis of these structures rather than subsequent
adaptive mechanisms that may have shaped language as a
communicative device.
<P>In order to argue for our interpretation of the available
data relevant to neurolinguistic capacity, we must explicate
exactly which aspects of brain structure were available,
compatible, and, ultimately, reappropriated.  We will not be
suggesting that linguistic progenitors used those structures
relevant to communication; language is unlikely to have evolved
directly from communication-based precursors, nor is it likely to
have been based on those structures that subserve communication.
A communication-based account can parsimoniously motivate neither
the precise neural character nor the apparent localization of
human language cortex.  Rather, as we will show in detail,
language came to utilize the processing strategies available from
newly evolving premotor cortex paired with those aspects of
neural organization that allow for amodal concept formation and
yield structured abstract representations.  These aspects of
neural organization arose as byproducts of the evolution of the
brain with respect to the regulation of repatterned motor
programs dedicated to the novel manual manipulative abilities and
requisite feedback circuits associated with eye-hand coordination
accompanying the hominid shift to bipedal locomotion.
<P>Lieberman (1984, 1985, 1989, 1992) also presents a
reappropriationist account of language origins (although, of
course, he did not use our term).  He suggests that the neural
tissue that was preadaptive for syntax and phonology emerged as a
response to selective pressures for motor control of the
articulators for speech.  While we are sympathetic to such a
preadaptationist position with respect to the evolutionary
biology of language origins, our interpretation of the
anthropological data differs radically from Lieberman's.  No
aspect of our account is motivated by selective pressures for
articulatory processes or improved "speech" capacity.  In fact,
as will become clear in the sections that follow, we place the
reappropriation "incident" leading to linguistic capacity as long
as 2 million years before the development of a modern vocal
articulatory system.
3.  Basic neuroanatomy
<P>Before turning to the particulars of the evolution of the
neuroanatomical structures that we wish to highlight, we review
our basic assumptions about the neuroanatomy of language.  It is
now generally accepted that a portion of the posterior aspect of
the third frontal convolution (Broca's area) and the region
including the posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus
(Wernicke's area) of the left cerebral hemisphere (for nearly all
right-handed, and most left-handed individuals) are the two brain
regions most closely associated with linguistic ability.  A
lateral view of the left hemisphere, with the language-relevant
structures represented, is given in Figure 1a.
<P>Insert Figure 1 about here
<P>Of particular significance for our thesis is the region
known as the parieto-occipito-temporal cortex (see Sanides,
1975).  This region includes, in humans, that portion of the
brain referred to as Wernicke's area.  Geschwind, in his well-
known 1965 paper that became an early standard for neurolinguists
(Disconnexion syndromes in animals and man), outlined the
probable significance of this general area (especially the
inferior parietal lobule) for language processing.  This emphasis
on the traditionally recognized "language areas" is not meant to
underestimate the involvement of other brain regions in language.
The claim is not that language relies exclusively on these areas,
rather it is a more modest one: that these areas are necessarily,
but not exclusively, involved in language.
<P>Figure 2 shows the primary sensory and motor areas of the
cortex.  As can be seen, these primary areas tend to lie along
major sulci.  As a general rule, the major fissures and sulci
approximate the boundaries between zones that are characterized
by distinct cell size, shape, density, and laminar organization.
In other words, they delineate discrete cytoarchitectonic areas
or signal the boundaries between adjacent architectonic fields
(see for example Sanides, 1975; Welker, 1990).  The
cytoarchitectonic areas thus defined tend to be functionally as
well as morphologically discrete.  (See Wakefield, 1993; we
return to this important point below.)
<P>Insert Figure 2 about here
<P>As can be seen in Figure 2, there is close proximity of
secondary (terminal) association areas for visual, auditory, and
somatosensory information at the periphery of the parieto-
occipito-temporal junction (POT).  The POT itself receives
elaborately processed uni- and bi-modal input from these
association cortices and maintains a high degree of internal
connectivity.  The POT is, in essence, an area of integration for
the three neocortical sensory association areas (Pandya and
Yeterian, 1985).  Incoming information is extensively, locally
integrated and outgoing pathways are extremely selective with
respect to the parts of the brain to which they project.  What we
designate as the POT has been referred to as the "association
area of association areas" (Geschwind's 1965 term).
<P>Broca's area, in the posterior portion of the third frontal
convolution, lies anteriorly adjacent to motor association
cortex.  As the ample literature on Broca's aphasia indicates,
there is no consensus on the role this area plays in linguistic
processing.  We will present evidence in subsequent sections,
however, that like the POT, neither the location nor the
functional properties of Broca's area are in any sense
fortuitous.  Specifically, this region will be shown to have
inherited its functional organization from the motor association
cortex from which it evolutionarily derives.  In an abstract
sense (i.e., non-language-specific), the specialization of this
region is temporal sequencing (Tallal and Schwartz, 1980) and the
hierarchical organization of information (Greenfield, 1992).
Highly structured, multi-sensory, neocortical information,
uniquely integrated via a POT-generated processing format feeds
directly (and reciprocally) to Broca's area via the major fiber
tract (fasciculus) connecting the frontal and parietal cortices
(see Figure 1b).  We suggest that once this anatomical feedback
system emerges through the appropriately adaptive evolutionary
mechanisms (which, we argue, have little if any relation to
language-specific selection), so too do the appropriable
foundations of linguistic capacity.  We elaborate this issue in
our discussion of primate brain evolution.
4.  Brain evolution in the primates
<P>4.1. Historical reconstruction
<P>With this summary material in mind, we can turn particular
attention to underlying organizational changes in the brain
during the course of primate evolution that resulted in the two
major neural organizational patterns, pongid and hominid, that we
will emphasize.  As will become clear, this dichotomy will be
based on distinctive positioning of major sulcal divisions.
<P>As in the reconstruction of evolutionary trends more
generally, there are two avenues of approach to the
reconstruction of primate brain evolution.  The first is direct
and involves the examination of fossil skulls and the use of
these skullcases as molds for latex models, or endocasts, of the
brains they once contained.  Occasionally, natural endocasts
appear in the fossil record as well, formed by geological
processes.
<P>The most basic analysis possible given such materials is one
of overall size.  Brain size, both absolute and relative to the
size of the body, increased over the course of primate evolution,
especially in the area of the cerebral cortex.
<P>Not only has the brain changed in size during the course of
evolution, it has also undergone, more importantly, changes in
organization.  Evidence for changes in organization comes from
the examination of endocasts; the brain leaves positive
impressions of major sulci on the interior surface of the skull
and the sulcal pattern is reproduced on the endocasts (Radinsky,
1968).  Shifts in placement of sulci throughout brain evolution
reflect shifts in underlying neural organization.  There is,
however, an extreme paucity of appropriate material.  Presently
there are only some 40 to 50 endocasts of fossil hominids
available for study, and most of these are incomplete (Holloway,
1983a).  The matter is further complicated by the fact that there
is much debate over the correct interpretation of the endocasts.
We return to this matter directly.
<P>The claim that organization can be inferred from sulcal
pattern is admittedly controversial.  We adopt this view,
however, because the brain can be expected, in a mechanical
sense, to adhere to the same principles of deformation as other
solid objects under the laws of physics.  In brief summary, we
suggest that the enlarging brain deforms in exactly those
locations where fields of distinct cytoarchitectonic structure
and organization come into close proximity.  The boundaries
between distinct architectonic fields function as microstructural
"discontinuities" which, under conditions of mechanical stress,
facilitate the initiation and govern the placement of failure, or
folding, in the brain.
<P>4.2. The mechanics of deformation
<P>The deformational behavior of any solid, including the brain
we would suggest, is determined by its mechanical attributes
which, in turn, are determined in large part by the
microstructural properties of the material (e.g., strength of
atomic bonds, packing order of molecules and/or larger
constituents).  It is a general property of deformable solids
that imperfections in microstructure reduce a body's resistance
to deformation (Roorda, 1969; Dekkers and Heikens, 1986).  Under
conditions of mechanical stress, the external force applied to a
structure is propagated through the material by way of
interatomic force fields.  In a homogeneous structure, the
applied stress is uniformly distributed throughout the material.
In heterogeneous materials, however, avenues of stress
propagation are disrupted when microstructural imperfections or
discontinuities are encountered (just as light "bends", for
example, at junctions of differing optical properties in the
media through which it is travelling).  The net effect of
propagation disruption is the concentration of stress at the site
of the discontinuity (Roorda, 1969; Smith and Sidebottom, 1969;
Rice, 1976; Dekkers and Heikens, 1986).  The phenomenon of stress
concentration is directly relevant to the phenomenon of folding,
for it is at the sites of highest stress that localized
deformation is initiated (Nadia, 1950; Means, 1976; Rice, 1976;
Jaroszewski, 1984; Dekkers and Heikens, 1986).
<P>These principles, as noted, are applicable to any solid that
undergoes deformation in response to conditions of stress and are
therefore applicable as well to the surface of the brain as it
undergoes the mechanical stresses associated with growth and
development.  The architectonic areas into which the neocortex is
divided are identified by regional differences in the numbers,
kinds, and arrangements of neurons, neuron processes (axons and
dendrites), glial cells, and myelination patterns throughout the
neocortical layers.  As in experimental situations (e.g. Dekkers
and Heikens, 1986), the neural boundaries between architectonic
areas appear to function as stress concentrators as a result of
the abrupt change in microstructure, therefore of mechanical
properties.  Deformational energy is particularly concentrated at
architectonic boundaries that separate regions of highly
disparate cell organization.  From a mechanical perspective, the
sites expected to deform most consistently across a species'
brain would be those associated with the most pronounced
architectonic transitions, or boundaries.  The relatively uniform
placement of the major, or primary, sulci within species appears
to conform to this prediction (see Welker, 1990).
<P>The pattern of such primary sulci may be used in the
identification of a species.  Importantly, these patterns
(reconstructed in endocast form) are the only biophysical
evidence available regarding brain organization in the fossil
record.  Based on mechanical principles, systematic shifts in the
placement of primary sulci during primate evolution may be
considered evidence of systematic shifts in underlying
architectonic boundary conditions.
<P>4.3. Comparative primate neuroanatomy
<P>The second, indirect method for studying brain evolution
is through comparative primate neuroanatomy.  Brains from extant
primates can be examined at the macro- and microscopic levels in
order to resolve questions of structural and functional
relationships.  In the case of evolutionary reconstruction, given
known phylogenetic relationships and structural similarities
between groups of living and extinct primates, the results of
such studies can be used to supplement fossil evidence.
<P>The paleoneurological evidence with which we are primarily
concerned is that dated between approximately 4 million and one
hundred thousand years before the present, for at some point
during this period the first hominid with a brain suitable for
the acquisition of language emerged.  For the purposes of
determining the origins of human language then, two questions
become central: Which of the fossil hominid species was the first
to exhibit the appropriate neural configuration?  From what
specific evidence might the identification of this configuration
be reliably inferred?  Before proceeding to a discussion of the
relevant fossil documentation, we pause here to examine these
questions themselves in detail.
<P>With respect to the first issue, we note that the brains of
the extant hominoidea approximate one of two fundamental neural
configurations: the pongid configuration, expressed in the brains
of the great apes, or the hominid configuration, expressed in the
human brain.  We cannot assume that the first hominids, the
australopithecines, identified as such primarily on the basis of
post-cranial material (i.e., body parts inferior to the head),
necessarily possessed a hominid brain morphology.  It is well
established that evolutionary mechanisms rarely effect all
subsystems of the organism at the same rate and/or intensity.
More often a mosaic pattern predominates in which a particular
portion of organismal subsystems may undergo significant
evolutionary modification while another portion may experience
relative stasis.  Certain of the early hominid morphological
characteristics, for example those associated with bipedal
locomotion, may have conformed to general hominid criteria prior
to the time at which the brain did so.  Therefore we must ask
whether the transition from a pongid to a hominid neural
configuration occurred simultaneously with the transition from
pongid to hominid post-cranial morphology or whether the
fundamental changes in brain organization occurred during a later
transition between descendent species within the hominid group.
The answer to this question must be sought through the lines of
evidence germane to the second issue, that of inference of form
=66rom fossil evidence.  In order to introduce the relevant lines
of evidence, we refer again to the fundamental dichotomy in
primate brain organization.
<P>4.3.1. Posterior configuration
<P>The pongid pattern can be illustrated by the brain of the
common chimpanzee, as shown in Figure 3a.  Of particular
relevance in characterizing the pongid pattern is the prominent
position of the lunate sulcus; in the pongid brain, the lunate
provides an overt anatomical marker of the parietal/occipital
boundary.  This marker allows us, on gross inspection, to
estimate the relative extent of posterior tissue types, or the
amount (simplistically speaking) of parietal cortex relative to
occipital cortex.  Portions of the brain, like portions of the
total organism, may undergo a mosaic pattern of evolutionary
modification which serves to shift interneural component ratios;
ultimately, such shifts define the fundamental organization and
processing strategy characteristic of each species.  For the
purposes of this discussion, we take the distinct position of the
lunate sulcus in the chimpanzee (and in the gorilla and
orangutan) to be a primary indicator of a typically pongid
posterior neural organization.
<P>Insert Figure 3 about here
<P>The hominid sulcal pattern, as illustrated in Figure 3b, is
distinctly different.  It has been well established that
throughout human evolution there has been a marked expansion of
association cortices relative to other parts of the brain.  The
extensive parietal expansion, in particular, has induced a
downward rotation of lateral cortex, effectively "pushing" the
lunate sulcus to an inferior-medial position.  This parietal
expansion, in the absence of concurrent occipital expansion, has
also shifted the lunate to a position significantly more
posterior than the position in which it is found in the pongid
condition (see Figure 4).  As a consequence, we find that most
human cerebral hemispheres do not show gross morphological
evidence of a lunate sulcus on the lateral surface, the position
reproducible on endocasts.  In those human hemispheres that do
show lateral evidence of the lunate, the relative position of the
sulcus is well back of the pongid position.  In general, the
hominid pattern of posterior organization is characterized by the
absence of an observable lunate sulcus.
<P>Insert Figure 4 about here
<P>With the marked expansion of parietal cortex, coupled with
continued expansion of the posterior temporal lobe initiated in
earlier stages of primate brain evolution, neural topography
becomes consistent with the expression of a region of confluence
of the parietal, occipital, and temporal association cortices in
the area we have referred to as the POT.  The pongid brain,
lacking sufficient parietal expansion (as signalled by the
prominence of a lunate sulcus that has not migrated toward the
inferior medial aspect of the cerebral hemisphere) is not
topographically consistent with a posterior organization
inclusive of a POT.  We suggest that this difference is directly
relevant to the manifestation of behavioral distinctions,
particularly those associated with language, that differentiate
apes and humans, an important matter to which we turn shortly.
<P>While our focus here has been on neural organization at the
gross anatomical level, any evolutionary reorganizational
processes that are involved in the conversion of a basic pongid
neural structure to a basic hominid neural structure must
ultimately take place at the level of cell-cell interactions
(see, e.g., Holloway, 1983b, p. 111).  At this fundamental level
of inquiry, necessarily inferential due to lack of appropriate
fossilized material, we must provide principled argument.  In
order to do so, we must examine in finer detail certain
properties of neural organization requisite to language and the
neuroevolutionary mechanisms by which these properties may be
established.
<P>Geschwind (1964 and elsewhere) has suggested that a
fundamental component of linguistic capacity is the ability to
"name", to associate a symbol with an object or action.
Importantly, the symbol need not be produced through the same
perceptual system that perceives the named object (or action).
For example, auditorily perceived acoustic signals represent
objects identifiable by visual means.  Geschwind states,
therefore, that this ability to name is dependent on the ability
to form cross-modal associations between (at least) two
modalities.
<P>While the situation is neither as simple nor as
straightforward as Geschwind claimed in this early work, his
suggestions do lead to certain important insights.  It is true
that in humans, the association cortices of vision, taction, and
somesthesis converge in pairs before final transfer to the POT.
That is, the primary input to the POT derives from three multi-
modal sources: auditory-visual convergence, auditory-somesthetic
convergence, and visual-somesthetic convergence.  By the time
sensory information is transferred to the POT, it has already
undergone higher order processing and relinquished its uni-modal
character; POT representation of sensory input is therefore
entirely modality-non-specific, or modality-free (see Pandya and
Yeterian, 1985).
<P>As neocortex has evolved, so too has the extent to which
neocortical neurons are locally, or internally, connected.  This
is apparent in the patterns of cytoarchitecture revealed through
the comparative study of posterior primate association cortex.
In the monkey, for example, there exists a tri-modal junction at
which information from all three neocortical sensory modalities
converges; the information that converges there is not, however,
multi-modally integrated and can, in one processing step, be
traced to its modality of origin (Pandya and Yeterian, 1985).
Information at this junction in the monkey brain cannot be
considered modality-free because the modality-specific signature
of incoming signals has not degenerated through intermediate
integration processes.  Because of the similarity of posterior
neocortical anatomy in monkeys and apes, we assume that the
processing situation is similar for the two.  This is supported
by the behavioral manifestations to which we now turn.
<P>The distinctive pattern of connectivity, which we suggest is
responsible for the creation of modality-free associations (or
"information"), is partly responsible, we also suggest, for a
distinctive human behavioral manifestation.  According to work by
Humphrey et al. (1979) and Wagner et al. (1981), humans, even
infants, have the ability to form amodal concepts considerably
more abstract than the instantiations in the data to which they
are exposed.  This is discussed in the literature on what is
referred to as "metaphorical mapping."  Humphrey et al. (1979)
demonstrated that infants as young as 3 months, when presented
with a specific temporal sequence pattern simultaneously through
visual and auditory channels, form a representation of the
temporal pattern itself.  Importantly, the representation of
temporal pattern is not bound to either of the modalities of
presentation.  In related research, this representational ability
on the part of infants has been confirmed with respect to
stimulus properties including ascendancy and descendancy,
continuity/discontinuity, and hardness (see Wagner et al. 1981;
Sepehr et al., 1988 (includes visual-tactile presentations)).
Such studies validate the claim that while information from the
environment must clearly be perceived through one or more of the
senses, the representation of that information is not bound to
the perceiving modality.  We will return to the importance of
this point for language acquisition in Sections 7 and 8.
<P>Equally important is the fact that while nonhuman primates
are capable of certain cross-modal tasks (i.e., recognizing a
particular object visually after tactile presentation; see
Ettlinger and Wilson, 1990), they are incapable, even with
intense training, of forming the type of amodal representation
apparently necessary for metaphorical matching.  Ettlinger
(1981), in showing that chimpanzees give no evidence of this sort
of ability, and in teasing apart cross-modal and metaphorical
matching abilities, notes that "in the chimpanzee, physical
identity seems to serve as a bridge between vision and touch
whereas attributed common properties (e.g., "strength of
stimulus", "local continuity/discontinuity") do not" (p. 585).
<P>We suggest that these studies are indicative of a uniquely
human ability to identify distinctive properties of presented
data and then to characterize them in sufficiently abstract form
as to allow them to be generalizable across situations.  This
ability, which we might refer to as the abstraction of
properties, and which is not in any way bound to a particular
perceptual modality, might well form the basis for (linguistic)
lexicalization.  Because of the particular cytoarchitectonic
character of the POT (especially its level of internal neuronal
connectivity), it does not seem unreasonable to expect that it is
the POT (present in humans, but not in monkeys or apes) that is
responsible for the ability to abstract properties (in concert
with Broca's area, as we will argue below).
<P>We are led to this speculation about the fundamental
importance of the abstraction of properties for linguistic
lexicalization by the myriad studies of lexical relations in
recent years by linguists from many different backgrounds.
Almost any analysis of the nature of the lexicon resorts
ultimately to some sort of lexical (semantic) decomposition, that
is, the breaking down of lexical units into component parts (or
features).  While there is much disagreement about the nature of
this decomposition and about which features are the correct ones,
there seems to be little doubt that the features must be
sufficiently abstract as to be generalizable not only across
linguistic categories (e.g. syntactic class) but also across
conceptual fields (e.g. location, possession, orientation, etc.).
We return to this important issue in Section 7.
<P>4.3.2. Anterior configuration
<P>While we have presented this line of reasoning couched in a
discussion of the evolutionary construction of the POT area, the
methods and principles as specified are equally applicable to
remaining portions of neocortex.  Of particular interest is their
application to the evolutionary construction of a functional
Broca's area, for much the same comparative situation exists
between pongids and hominids in this region.  Neither strictly
homologous cytoarchitectonic fields (vonBonin and Bailey, 1961)
nor gross sulcal morphology (Sarnat and Netsky, 1981) consistent
with the more highly evolved human pattern is present in the
anterior regions of the non-human primate brain (see Figure 3).
<P>It is relevant to ask what the cellular nature of Broca's
area is such that it functions to support linguistic capacity.
As with the discussion of the POT, careful analysis of
organization and functioning at the neuronal level would be
inappropriate for our purposes here.  The implicit intention of
our discussion of Broca's area is to suggest that it is a
processing module whose inherent specialization is the
hierarchical structuring of information in a format consistent
with a temporally ordered linear sequence reflective of that
structure.  We argue (see Section 7) that this is, in fact, the
underlying function of Broca's area in linguistic processing (see
Greenfield, 1992, for discussion of hierarchical coding and
Broca's area).
<P>It is important to recall that there is a major tract of
association fibers that connects the frontal and parieto-temporal
modules that we have been discussing (see Figure 1b).  The
existence of this major connective pathway signals the immediate
availability of information processed in either of these areas to
the other.  This would mean that the amodal representations,
resulting from sensory input to the POT, are available to Broca's
area and, hence, subject to the imposition of hierarchical
structure.  It is our contention that the abstraction of
properties is not possible in the absence of the capacity for
hierarchical structuring.  In order to generalize abstract
features across categories one must first be cognizant of the
feature composition of the perceived stimulus.  To know that
identifiable "wholes" are composed of distinctive "parts," or in
other words that constituents can be further analyzed into
smaller constituents, would seem to be the essence of
hierarchically structured cognition.  The abstraction of
properties, like other important aspects of human cognition,
requires a POT and a Broca's area working in concert.
Importantly, Broca's area and the POT, as we will discuss in the
following section, appear evolutionarily at the same time;
because they are so intimately connected, this is not surprising
(or accidental; see Wakefield, 1993).
5.  Australopithecus and Homo habilis
<P>Sometime between 10 and 4 million years ago, a separation in
primate lineages took place, giving rise on one hand to the
living African apes, and to humans on the other.  Of the
hominids, Australopithecus is the earliest and most primitive
genus.  At some point between 2.5 and 2 million years ago,
largely contemporaneous with at least one species of
Australopithecus, there appeared a second hominid genus, believed
to be descended from one of the (gracile) australopithecines.
Its most primitive member, Homo habilis, is intermediate in many
morphological features between the more primitive
Australopithecus and later, more advanced members of its own
genus (H. erectus, H. sapiens).  The first appearance of stone
tools (crude choppers and scrapers) is roughly coincident with
the appearance of H. habilis in the fossil record, suggesting
that this species produced and used these artifacts (Harris,
1983), although the later H. erectus is the first fossil primate
with a substantial archeological record. By approximately 100,000
years ago, the hominids inhabiting Africa and the Middle East
(and 40,000 years ago in Europe) were anatomically modern H.
sapiens, similar to living populations (Fleagle, 1988).
<P>5.1. The lunate sulcus and the POT
<P>As mentioned, expansion of the posterior parietal cortex
through time pushed the lunate sulcus from its more anterior
pongid position to the inferior medial position typical of the
human brain; given the presumed role the POT plays in language
processing, the significance of this organizational shift is
clear.  Central to the task of determining when the shift to a
human-like brain organization emerged is the issue of the
placement of the lunate sulcus on the Taung australopithecine
endocast (holotype, or "standard," for A. africanus).
<P>Dart (1925), in his first paper on the Taung child, reported
the lunate position to be relatively posterior, this shift from
the pongid configuration having resulted, he infers, from a
"general bulging of the parieto-temporal-occipital association
areas" (Dart, 1925, pp. 197-198).  Holloway (1970, 1974, 1975),
to the extent he found the endocasts interpretable at all,
concurred in this interpretation of a posterior, human-like
placement of the lunate sulcus impression.  Falk (1980), on re-
examination of the Taung, and in opposition to the original
report by Dart and those by Holloway, interpreted the position of
the lunate sulcus to be relatively anterior, as it appears in the
pongid brain.  Falk interprets the anteriorly-positioned,
furrowed marking under dispute to be the lunate sulcus, whereas
Dart and Holloway assume the marking to have been created by some
non-sulcal feature.
<P>Further, Falk's interpretation of the orbital surface of the
frontal lobe of seven australopithecine endocasts from the same
study corroborates this initial observation; the orbital surface,
at least in its lateral aspect, is, like the parietal cortex,
ape-like rather than human-like in its sulcal pattern.  She has
reasserted this claim of a pongid neural organization in
subsequent assessments of this material based on the lunate
sulcus position (Falk, 1983a, 1985a) as well as other
morphological criteria (Falk, 1985b; see also earlier work by
Holloway, 1983c, for interpretation and discussion of these
materials).  Falk has proposed, in addition, that with respect to
the Taung, the entire sulcal pattern appears ape-like (Falk,
1983a).  In turn, Holloway (1981, 1984, 1985) has repeatedly
disputed this interpretation based on his own examination of
these same materials, maintaining that the Taung endocast does
not reveal a pongid neural organization, but that the evidence
suggests a typically hominid organization.  Others (e.g., Tobias,
1987 and elsewhere) have determined the position of the Taung
lunate to be "decisively indeterminate".  Clearly, it is unlikely
that a consensus will be reached based solely on direct
examination of the "dimple" (Falk's term) that constitutes the
putative lunate sulcus on the Taung endocast.
<P>More recently, evidence bearing on the Taung interpretation
has been reported that is not dependent on positive
identification of the lunate, and which militates in favor of
Falk's assessment of australopithecine neural organization.
Jerison (1990), for example, argues that neural reorganization
involving preferential expansion of parietal cortex in the
australopithecines would have entailed certain unlikely
morphological changes in the medial aspect of the brain related
to occipital cortex.  This would be so because substantial
parietal expansion, under this scenario, would have needed to
occur without a corresponding substantial increase in overall
brain size (australopithecine brains are roughly comparable in
size to chimpanzee brains).  In light of the fact that the medial
region in question is similar in appearance among essentially all
placental mammals, it would be extremely unlikely (although
possible) that Australopithecus alone would have deviated from
the mammalian norm.  An interpretation of the australopithecine
lunate that places it in a human-like position, would require
such a deviation (Jerison, 1990).
<P>In related research, Armstrong and her colleagues
(Armstrong, Zilles, Curtis, and Schleicher, 1991) have utilized a
quantitative measure of neocortical folding (the Gyrification
Index, or GI), to address the question of whether cortical
reorganization (i.e., preferential expansion (hence increased
folding) of parietal cortex) occurred prior to the time at which
substantial overall brain size increases occurred or whether it
would necessarily have occurred in conjunction with such an
increase.  Because their gyrification analysis supports the
former scenario, and because the substantial overall size
increase in question during primate evolution postdates the
australopithecines, the evidence presented by Armstrong et al. is
consistent with Falk's interpretation of a pongid posterior
neural organization for Australopithecus.
<P>Holloway (1992) disputes the claim that GI data, collectable
only on the brains of extant species, can be brought to bear on
the issue of cortical organization in extinct species for which
the only database is endocast material.  It is true that the
amount of cortex buried within the sulci of a particular brain
cannot be determined from an endocast of that brain.  However, it
is also true that there is a significant correlation between the
mean GI for a given primate species and the sum of all sulcal
lengths as measured on an endocast from that species (Zilles,
Armstrong, Moser, Schleicher, and Stephan, 1989).  Hence, there
is a clear and consistent relationship between a measure that is
only possible on a whole brain and a measure that is available
=66rom a brain endocast (see discussion in Armstrong, Zilles, and
Schleicher, 1993).  This would suggest that the GI data should be
allowable evidence in the australopithecine neural organization
issue.
<P>Given the nature (and evident acrimony) of the debate about
the interpretation of the Australopithecus endocasts, there is
little prospect of any imminent consensus.  If Holloway is
correct, then the hominid posterior brain configuration we have
been considering might have emerged in specimens earlier than H.
habilis.  Based on the literature that we have reviewed, and
because it is the more conservative hypothesis for our purposes
with respect to the evolution of linguistic capacity, we suggest
that the australopithecine brain is unlikely to have undergone
adequate parietal expansion consistent with the development of a
POT.  This brings us then to the genus Homo.
<P>The most primitive member of this genus, H. habilis, appears
contemporaneously with certain of the more specialized, robust
forms of Australopithecus.  In the Koobi Fora region of Kenya,
both genera are represented in strata of approximately 2 million
years of age; endocasts prepared from the reconstructed skulls of
two individuals from this formation have been examined by Tobias
(1975 in Tobias, 1981) and Falk (1983b).  The australopithecine
endocast (dated between 1.26 and 1.8 MY), as revealed by the
fronto-orbital sulcus and overall basic shape, is argued to be of
pongid-like organization (Falk, 1983b).  In contrast, the
habiline endocast (older than 1.8 MY) reveals fundamentally
distinctive frontal, parietal and overall shape features which
clearly differentiate the brain of Homo habilis from that of
Australopithecus.  With respect to posterior organization, the
degree of development of the inferior parietal lobule of Homo
habilis appears to exceed that of the australopithecine; sulcal
evidence of the presence of well-developed supramarginal and
angular gyri is apparent in this specimen (similar evidence for
parietal expansion is also demonstrated on three habiline
endocasts from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania (Tobias, 1987)).  With the
emergence of a substantial inferior parietal lobule (and the
decided lack, subsequently, of an observable lunate sulcus), H.
habilis appears to have been the first species in which
researchers might agree that there is human posterior neural
organization.  She may therefore be considered the first
potential possessor of uniquely human modality-free sensory
representation.
<P>5.2. The frontal lobe and Broca's area
<P>The search for evidence of Broca's area in early hominid
forms has generated rather less controversy in the
paleoneurological literature.  The fronto-orbital sulcus, like
the lunate, is a characteristic gross morphological marker of the
pongid brain, but is absent in the human.  Using 3-dimensional
computer technology to reconstruct the Taung sulcal pattern, Falk
and colleagues (Falk, Hildeboldt and Vannier, 1989) demonstrated
that with respect to indications of a fronto-orbital sulcus, this
specimen expresses a pongid-like morphology.  As noted, Falk also
found the australopithecine endocasts in her 1980 study to be
pongid-like in their overall frontal lobe morphology, and the
Koobi Fora specimen (Falk, 1983b) to be so in overall shape as
well as by fronto-orbital criteria.
<P>In contrast, the fronto-orbital sulcus is absent in the
Koobi Fora H. habilis brain.  Further, the sulci that have been
identified as the horizontal and ascending branches of the
Sylvian sulcus on the Koobi Fora habiline endocast represent, in
extant humans, the anterior and posterior boundaries of the pars
triangularis (part of the inferior frontal gyrus) (Falk, 1983b).
An impression of the pars opercularis (the remaining portion of
the inferior frontal gyrus) is preserved on an H. habilis
specimen from Olduvai Gorge (Tobias, 1987); on two additional
habiline specimens from this site, human-like frontal lobe
morphology has been verified (Holloway, 1978; Tobias, 1987).
These data suggest that language-relevant frontal cortex (pars
opercularis and pars triangularis) is, insofar as can be
determined from gross morphological inspection, present in the
habiline brain (as a consequence of preferential expansion of the
inferior frontal gyrus).
<P>Given the fossil evidence as presented, and the (more or
less) converging interpretations of the same, we suggest that the
two primary language-relevant cortices, inferior frontal and
inferior parieto-temporal, appear simultaneously with the
emergence of Homo habilis.  The evolutionary shift from a pongid
to a hominid neural organization, then, insofar as can be
determined based on available evidence, probably occurred closer
to the present than did the transition from ape to hominid
postcranial morphology.  This is an example of the mosaic pattern
of evolution previously referred to.  With a relatively large,
but still organizationally pongid-like brain, Australopithecus
may have been more behaviorally capable than her predecessors,
but probably did not have the neural organization apparently
necessary for language.
<P>5.3. Lateralization
<P>Before leaving our discussion of potential incipient
language capacity in early hominids, we note that there is
supporting evidence in the fossil record bearing on the phenomena
of cerebral lateralization and handedness, two characteristically
human traits highly correlated with language.  Tobias (1987)
reports that of the three Olduvai Gorge habiline endocasts on
which the superior parietal lobule is bilaterally represented,
the impression of the left superior parietal lobule is more
strongly developed than that of the right.
Cytoarchitectonically-defined as well as gross anatomically-
defined parieto-temporal regions in the brains of modern humans
are typically larger in the left hemisphere than are their
counterparts in the right (Eidelberg and Galaburda, 1984;
Galaburda, Sanides, and Geschwind, 1978; Geschwind and Levitsky,
1968).  Such left hemisphere-biased asymmetries generally
correspond to preferential right-handedness and lateralization of
language to the left hemisphere.
<P>The parietal asymmetry in the brain of H. habilis allows the
introduction of archeological evidence corroborating asymmetric
specialization in these early humans from a behavioral rather
than a morphological perspective.  As has been well established,
the phenomenon of handedness is not one attributable to the hand
itself, but is an expression of cerebral hemispheric
specialization.  This phenomenon should manifest itself in the
refuse of any population in which preferential handedness is
characteristic and in which the material culture is sufficiently
developed.  It is significant then that in the Koobi Fora
sediments in which both A. boisei and H. habilis biological
remains have been recovered, so too have the first archaeological
artifacts representative of crude lithic technology.  H. habilis
rather than A. boisei is generally implicated in the production
and use of these early stone tools (Harris, 1983; Pilbeam, 1984;
Toth, 1987).  Toth (1985), based on a long-term experimental
research program of manufacturing and using such stone tools, and
comparing observations from these experiments with the
archaeological evidence, has determined that the manufacturers of
the Koobi Fora artifacts under consideration produced these tools
with blows from a hammerstone held preferentially in the right
hand.  Thus the habiline parietal asymmetry is mirrored by a
behavioral manifestation indicative of preferential left
hemisphere specialization that would be consistent with the
lateralization of function that accompanies language.
<P>We have concluded that there are significant differences,
evident in the fossil record, that distinguish H. habilis from
the australopithecines with respect to neurolinguistic
preconditions.  These include a demarcated Broca's area, an
identifiable POT (indicative of Wernicke's area), and
asymmetrical development of the cerebral hemispheres indicative
of handedness.  It is relevant now to ask how, and even why, such
changes in structure took place in this evolutionary line.
6.  Adaptations affecting the language areas
<P>The adaptations that resulted in an identifiable Broca's
area and POT, we will argue, involve the evolution of motor
programs dedicated to manual manipulation and throwing behavior,
each of which were crucial to the survival of early hominids (see
Calvin, 1982, 1983a,b, 1992).  The motor system modifications
relevant to use of the hand and thumb had important interactive
relationships with forelimb development, brain organization,
lateralization, and handedness, all of which have strong
correlations with linguistic capacity in modern humans.  Holloway
(1983b), in his work on the paleontological evidence relevant to
language, stresses the importance of "the increased competence in
visuospatial integration and manual dexterity associated with
hunting behavior, and in particular, complex throwing behavior
and tool making" (p. 112).
<P>As already mentioned, primate brain evolution is
characterized by a progressive increase in brain size relative to
body size.  Lashley (1949) and others following his lead (e.g.
Jerison, 1973, 1976) were among the first cognitive
neuroscientists to suggest that the foundations of cognition (and
intelligence) can be traced to those neural structures that have
developed in excess of the neuronal quantity necessary to
maintain the anatomical substance of the organism.  Even though
the basis for cognition cannot be so simplistically localized,
much of this type of excess neuronal material makes up the
neocortex, particularly the frontal and parieto-temporal
association cortices.  In other words, the neuronal material not
directly associated with particular anatomical functions is that
which is evolutionarily more recent.  This evolutionary
development is, of course, correlated with cognitive development.
<P>6.1. Manual manipulation and somatosensory feedback
<P>As can be seen in Figure 2, the primary motor area of the
frontal lobe and the primary somatosensory area of the parietal
lobe lie along opposite sides of the central sulcus.  These two
primary areas work in concert for the many motor behaviors that
require sensory regulation (Phillips, 1969; Bossom, 1974; Fromm
and Evarts, 1977; Evarts and Fromm, 1978).  For example, the
simple gesture involved in reaching out, grasping, and lifting a
glass requires not only motor manipulation but also somatosensory
feedback to regulate the amount of pressure applied to the grasp.
Too strong a grasp will result in broken glass; insufficient
pressure will preclude execution of the lift.  Many manual (as
well as other motor) behaviors require extensive sensory
feedback.  This is directly relevant to certain evolutionary
changes affecting the primate line, including tool use.
<P>The complexity of tool-using behavior correlates with other
important evolutionary developments.  Central to our argument is
the fact that this involves developments of the hand and thumb
directly related to fine motor control and increased manual
dexterity.
<P>Archaeological evidence for the emergence of such behaviors
and fossilized evidence of the morphological modifications with
which they are associated are relatively abundant and well
established in the record of human evolution.  We have previously
remarked upon, with respect to the evidence of handedness, the
remains of lithic tools manufactured by H. habilis.  Marzke
(1971, 1983, 1991; Marzke and Shackley, 1986) has been
instrumental in delineating and elucidating the morphological
characteristics and evolutionary modifications of the hominid
hand with respect to the grips, movements, and resistance to
external forces associated with both the manufacture (flaking)
and use of such hand-held tools.  These same modifications, she
notes (Marzke, 1983), are crucial to the process of stone-
throwing, another aspect of the tool-related repertoire of
behaviors associated with H. habilis remains.  Isaac (1987) has
examined the presence of large numbers of unmodified stones, of a
type unsuitable for flaked tools but associated nevertheless with
the archaeological sites containing early modified stone
artifacts; she concludes that from the perspective of simple
defense and hunting, the investment of energy in transporting the
stones from the source for use as ballistic weapons would have
been well justified.  Calvin (1982, 1983a,b, 1992) has repeatedly
stressed the potential for enhanced fitness brought about by the
capacity for accurate and dependable action-at-a-distance
predation.  For example, one cannot generally get close enough to
a wild game animal, such as a rabbit, to capture it before it
runs away; a well-aimed, one-arm throw of reasonable force,
however, can overcome this obstacle in the procurement of food
(two-handed throwing disallows sufficient range).  Morphological
variation within a population that improves an individual's
capacity to perform such acts becomes a prime candidate for
selectional attention.
<P>Morphological modifications of the hominid hand facilitating
such motoric behaviors are, in themselves, insufficient as a
basis for fine, visuo-spatially sophisticated manipulative
capacity.  Equally motivated by selectional pressures for such
capacity, particularly with respect to the manufacture and/or use
of stone tools (including throwing), are corresponding increases
in dedication of motor and sensory cortices to the musculature
and receptors of the hand (for relevant discussion see Washburn,
1959, 1960; Isaac, 1981; Isaac, 1987; Calvin, 1982, 1983a,b,
1992; Marzke and Shackley, 1986; Marzke, 1991).
<P>Manipulatory and throwing behaviors require not only motor
control, but, as discussed above, somatosensory feedback.  This
portends the need for extensive integration of information from
the motor and somatosensory cortices.  Evolutionarily this has
meant that the expansion of primary motor cortex has necessitated
a concomitant expansion of primary somatosensory cortex,
resulting in a complex feedback loop involving the two areas.
<P>The functional interdependence of motor and somatosensory
dynamics in primates, especially as concerns our claims with
respect to a feedback loop, is best appreciated by reference to
the evolution of the sensorimotor system in mammals more
generally.  In extremely primitive mammals, such as the
marsupial, there is no distinction between "motor" cortex and
"somatosensory" cortex; the lateral aspect of the brain is
characterized by completely overlapping functional fields, a
"sensorimotor amalgam," that subserves both functions
simultaneously (Lende, 1969).  In this configuration, somatic
information required by any particular motor neuron may be
supplied by the adjacent sensory neurons.  As the mammalian
sensorimotor system evolved, particularly in those lineages in
which manipulatory behaviors play an important role in survival
(e.g., squirrels, raccoons), differentiation of the two
components led to motor localization in the anterior aspect of
the cortex and somatosensory localization in the posterior aspect
(Woolsey, 1958; Lende, 1969).  Maintenance of the required mutual
feedback system was facilitated by the parallel evolution of a
myelinated bundle of motor and sensory axons that could feed
relevant information from each subsystem directly to the other.
<P>In the anthropoid primates, the cytoarchitectonic
differentiation of motor and somatosensory cortices has
progressed to the extent that the central sulcus, which separates
the two, has become an identifying characteristic of the order.
Further, the arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculi,
portions of which interconnect the two components, have become
principle myelinated axon tracts.
<P>In light of this anatomico-functional relationship, we note
that certain aspects of cortical expansion through evolution of
one or the other of the sensorimotor subsystems would have to be
constrained by, and have consequences for, evolution and
expansion of the other.  For example, as the morphology of the
bones and muscles of the primate hand underwent evolutionary
changes in response to selective pressures toward manipulatory
behavior, so too did the motor cortex evolve in order to keep
pace with such (peripheral) changes.  The inherent organization
of the sensorimotor system of the primates then requires that
somatosensory cortex evolve in order to keep pace with (central)
changes in motor cortex.  Ultimately, it is the system as a whole
that must be functionally balanced.  In light of what is known
about the evolution of the hand and concomitant changes in both
motor and sensory cortices, the prediction is that if motor
cortex (or motor association cortex) expands through evolutionary
mechanisms, an associated expansion of somatosensory cortex (or
somatosensory association cortex) must also take place.  Further,
some portion of the axons from these expanded regions must be
incorporated as part of the interconnecting fasciculus.  As noted
by Pandya and Yeterian (1985), this appears to be precisely the
case: each architectonic subdivision of the sensory association
cortex is directly and reciprocally connected to a subdivision of
motor association cortex with which it shares an equivalent state
of evolutionary differentiation.
<P>The differential cytoarchitectonics of these evolutionary
"appendages" to motor and sensory association cortices reflect
underlying differences in the exact pattern of neuronal
connections within each unit.  In general, the further away a
sensorimotor cytoarchitectonic region is located from the central
sulcus, the more recently it has evolved, the further removed it
is from direct connections to the peripheral organs of the body,
and the more module-internal are the majority of its synaptic
connections (for discussion of the developmental mechanisms
responsible for this arrangement, see Katz and Lasek, 1978;
Aboitiz, 1988).  The increasing departure from direct association
with the body and the increasing degree of internal or intrinsic
connectivity associated with evolutionarily more recent
cytoarchitectonic regions is generally taken to generate as a
byproduct, as noted, the foundations of cognition (as per
Jerison, 1973).
<P>6.2. Incipient linguistic capacity
<P>With respect to the evolutionary emergence of
cytoarchitectonic regions compatible with linguistically
formatted cognition, we suggest the following scenario.  During
the neocortical expansion associated with selection for the hand
and manipulatory capacities, frontal and parietal cortices
evolved in a manner consistent with the principles outlined in
the preceding subsection.  At some point between the time of the
australopithecines and H. habilis, the frontal motor association
cortex expansion that resulted in the pars triangularis and pars
opercularis of the inferior frontal convolution was coupled with
the parietal sensory association cortex expansion that resulted
in the enhancement of the angular and supramarginal gyri and the
shift of the lunate sulcus to its inferior medial, nonpongid
position.  These simultaneously evolving cortices, Broca's area
and the POT, are reciprocally connected by a major axon tract,
remote from connection to the body, and highly intrinsically
connected, as would be expected of neocortical areas subserving
cognitive functions.
<P>We suggest that the configuration of the association cortex,
derived from primary motor and sensory cortices and motivated via
selection for neural control of the evolving hand, provided a
foothold for the operations involved in linguistic processing.
This does not imply that the respective roles of the POT or of
Broca's area in language were in any sense predetermined.
Rather, functional changes in parietal and frontal structures
proceeded even as did changes in the structures themselves (for
general discussion of relevant principles, see Bock, 1959;
Futuyma, 1986, p. 424).  It is our contention that, as a
consequence of the configurational compatibility, these parietal
and frontal substrates were subsequently reappropriated for
language and, ultimately, for linguistically formatted
communication.  The shift in placement of the lunate sulcus as a
result of the motor-sensory expansion was illustrated
schematically in Figure 4.
<P>Recall that at the same time that the manual behaviors under
selection were developing and becoming more complex, so too was
brain function becoming lateralized (as indicated by the
development of right-handedness among the habilines).  This
phenomenon derives from the nature of the behaviors for which we
are claiming selective advantage.  As noted, in throwing, a two-
handed release allows neither sufficient force nor acceleration
for an advantageous weapon trajectory.  In flaking stones, one
hand is used to steady the target (or core) stone while the
skilled movement is executed by the other.  With selection
operating for behaviors associated with unilateral performance,
the stage may be set for preferential handedness and cerebral
lateralization.
7.  Conceptual Structure
<P>If our account proves valid, by the time of H. habilis the
marked sulcal division between the parietal and occipital lobes
had "disappeared."  In addition, there were other significant
evolutionary changes affecting the hominid brain.  These include
the expansion of visual cortex and of the temporal lobe.  The
close proximity and resultant junction of the three posterior
lobes culminated in a situation in which information was readily
available for processing in an overlap of the three related
association areas and which could result in amodal
representation.
<P>It is important to note at this point that, in light of the
size of axon tracts between neural structures, geographical
proximity is not necessary for processing connections.  It is the
case, however, that proximal location and organization is often
the rule for related functions.  This can be exemplified by a
consideration of the organization of motor and somatosensory
functions on either side of the central sulcus.  In the POT area,
close proximity of the association areas for sight, audition, and
the tactile sense results in the facilitated integration of
sensory information.
<P>The POT allows for a particular way of organizing perceptual
information that we believe to be necessary for the typically
human amodal representation of abstract features.  Recall that
humans, but apparently neither monkeys nor apes, can abstract
distinctive properties from sensory input and apply those
properties in the processing of sensory information from various
modalities or, in other words, accomplish what was called
metaphorical matching (see Section 4.3.1).  We suggest that this
is the substance associated with the process Jerison (1976)
refers to as the uniquely human "construction of reality."
<P>This human manner of building reality, utilizing the
integration of information from the various modalities is derived
directly from the facts of neurology.  It would not seem
unreasonable, then, to expect a theory of cognition (a higher
level of abstraction) to be responsible to similar
considerations.  Cognition must, of course, ultimately be
instantiated in the brain.  The proposed cognitive construct
(relevant to language) most apparently compatible with this view
of neurology is Jackendoff's Conceptual Structure (1983, 1987,
1990, and elsewhere).
<P>Conceptual Structure (henceforth CS) is the central concept
in a theory of semantics that integrates meaning as relevant to
language with meaning as relevant to other cognitive domains.  CS
is explicitly developed in order to serve not only the concerns
of linguistic theory but also those of theories of vision, music,
motor systems, etc.  It is to be seen, in fact, as the level of
structure relevant to all cognitive domains.  Jackendoff (1983,
p. 17) says:
<P>There is a single level of mental representation,
<P>conceptual structure, at which linguistic, sensory, and
<P>motor information are compatible.
<P>
<P>CS, as conceived of here, and based on Jackendoff, is made up of
basic ontological categories and constituents put together
according to CS-specific rules of combination.  The basic
categories generalize across semantic fields and across
conceptual modalities.  The rules of combination construct
higher-level constituents, such as STATES and EVENTS, out of the
basic categories, such as THINGS and PATHS.  For example, a
sentence involving the verb throw (e.g. Ben threw the ball to the
dog) would include a representation of an EVENT in which a THING
(a ball) goes along a PATH from THING (Ben) to a different THING
(the dog).  Because this is a causal EVENT, one THING (Ben)
CAUSEs the ACT in which the THING (ball) is acted upon.  (This is
discussed in more formal terms in Section 8.1.)
<P>Importantly, CS is not part of the linguistic system per se.
Rather, the linguistic system is related to CS through a set of
correspondence rules.  The theory of CS is a theory of mental
representation, and to the extent to which CS can be shown to
provide for a successful linguistic semantics, semantics will not
be part of the strictly linguistic domain.  From this point of
view, the theory of grammar deals with syntax and phonology;
semantics falls under the theory of CS.
<P>To relate the discussion of CS more directly to what we have
said regarding neuroanatomical structure, we suggest that CS is
the cognitive construct that is produced by the POT through its
interaction with Broca's area.  By virtue of the POT, human
sensory input is highly processed in association cortex and loses
its modality-specific character; by virtue of Broca's area's
influence on the POT, the amodal representations are subject to
hierarchical structuring.  Structured modality-neutral
representation, we suggest, is the essence of CS.  (Further,
amodality and hierarchical structure are necessary for feature
abstraction, to which we return shortly.)  The biological
configuration of the POT imparts the modality-neutrality of the
"semantic" representation.  In parallel fashion, the biological
configuration of Broca's area (and the connecting fasciculi)
imparts a hierarchical structuring to the representations.
Recall that Broca's area is derived from motor cortex.  Motor
cortex deals specifically with the innervation of muscle units,
the firing sequences of which must be coordinated by higher
levels of neural control organized in hierarchical fashion.
Because of the anatomical and physiological requirements
associated with the higher level organization of an ultimate
motor output, behaviors initiated by motor association cortex
must be functionally hierarchical.  Therefore, any behavior (or
cognition) associated with Broca's area will show evidence of
hierarchical structuring (see Greenfield, 1992).
<P>Taking this line of argumentation yet further, we suggest
that it is CS and its underlying biological basis that gives
language its referential character.  One of the most basic
characteristics of human language is its ability to refer, and a
basic characteristic of reference is the sense we all share that
there is a connection of some sort between words, on the one
hand, and things and/or events in the perceived world, on the
other.  Importantly, words and their denotations (however these
are ultimately to be characterized) are not limited to
connections involving only a single sense modality.  The features
necessary for even the simplest sort of naming and referring
would seem rarely to be drawn from a single modality.  This would
appear to be a natural consequence of a neurological and
cognitive arrangement wherein the integration of sense modality
information was not only natural but inevitable.  This capacity
for reference, one of the defining characteristics of human
language, is apparently not in the natural cognitive repertoire
of even the most sophisticated of the nonhuman primates (see
Terrace, 1985).  Whether or not apes can be taught to refer with
symbols, reference is not obviously an important characteristic
of nonhuman primate vocal communication systems.  Nor, evidently,
is there much evidence that apes comprehend the possible
referential functions of non-vocal (e.g. gestural) behaviors
(Savage-Rumbaugh, 1986).
<P>There is another aspect of the reference issue that should
here be mentioned.  Reference in human language is not limited to
the "here and now."  Language readily deals with past (or
possible future) events and objects not available to the
perceptual systems at the moment of the speech act.  F. Aboitiz
(personal communication) points out that keeping in mind, or
recalling, an object or event when it is not present evidently
involves working memory in the prefrontal lobe (Goldman-Rakic,
1984).  Prefrontal cortex is very well developed in humans and
Aboitiz suggests that its main role in human evolution may well
have been related to this sort of reference task.
<P>A third aspect of referential capacity is of particular
relevance here because it is arguably traceable to the important
neurobiological connection between Broca's area and the POT.  We
consider important the fact that, according to Savage-Rumbaugh
(1986), apes have great difficulty with what might be called
"referential specificity."  The vocabulary items that chimps can
learn correspond to:
<P>very global requests, such as for contact, play, food,
<P>or change of location.  However, as the human
<P>experimenters then attempt to teach symbols which
<P>denote more specific attributes of each of these
<P>situations (who is eating, what they are eating, the
<P>differences between eating and drinking, the act of
<P>transferring food from one individual to another, the
<P>pace of the transfer, etc.), the ape has difficulty in
<P>comprehending both the referents of such symbols and
<P>why their use results in anything more than the symbols
<P>he has already been taught to use when making requests.
<P>(p. 26, emphasis in the original)
<P>
<P>We would suggest that the ability to achieve referential
specificity is dependent upon the ability to analyze constituents
into their component parts, that is, to recognize that
constituents have distinctive sub-parts.  This, in turn, requires
the ability to abstract features, or generalize recognizable
properties, across non-identical instances (what we discussed
above in Section 4.3.1. in relation to metaphorical mapping).
Referential specificity, like so much else in natural language,
requires the ability to hierarchically structure abstract units.
For human infants, referential specificity is trivial; for the
chimp it is not obviously even achievable.  As far as the chimp
Nim is concerned, "Nim milk, give milk, Laura give Nim milk, more
milk" (Savage-Rumbaugh, 1986, p. 26) always result in Nim getting
more milk.  There is no evidence that the chimp, in responding to
such phrases, understands the specific referents of any single
symbol.  The chimp will string together any combination of
symbols that will result in a desired outcome, e.g. getting milk.
Chimps, at least Pan troglodytes, apparently do not have the
natural capacity to break abstract symbols, in this case the
phrases, down into their component parts.  This is due, we would
claim, to the fact that the chimp lacks a POT connected to a
Broca's area.
<P>More recent work with chimps paints a somewhat different
picture, especially for Pan paniscus.  Bonobos have shown a
considerable facility with language comprehension (as to some
extent have common chimps; see Savage-Rumbaugh, Brakke, and
Hutchins, 1992) and, more relevant to our concerns, certain
language learning abilities often thought to lie beyond the
capacities of apes.  As Savage-Rumbaugh, Murphy, Sevcik, Brakke,
Williams, and Rumbaugh (1993) amply documents, bonobos (and
probably even common chimps) have demonstrated the ability not
only to understand many (novel) sentences of spoken English, but
also to acquire words (represented by lexigrams) and word use
through "observational learning" (i.e. in the absence of overt
tutoring).  The ape who has most amply demonstrated this learning
capacity was raised in a naturalistic, culturally-enriched
environment in which he was exposed to spoken English and
lexigrams simultaneously (Savage-Rumbaugh, et al., 1993, p. 25).
While the apparent language learning abilities of this bonobo are
striking, his accomplishments do not directly serve to test the
evolutionary hypotheses put forth in the present account of the
emergence of language.
<P>For reasons related to the chimps' vocal inadequacies (for
linguistic phonetic expression), there was a need to expose the
research subject (and other subjects similarly raised) to
visually presented, manipulable symbols (the lexigrams) while he
was in the spoken English environment.  This mode of language
presentation has (at least) two important, relevant effects.
First, in such a linguistic environment there is a graphic
representation of the fact that the phonetic input (the acoustic
signal) could be decomposed into, and matched with, discrete
units.  Less obviously, this use of lexigrams also signaled that
the conceptual environment that was paired with the acoustic
signal could be represented in discrete, bounded, symbolic
"words."  This would seem to greatly simplify the acquisition
problem in exactly the way that an ape would require, namely, by
overtly and tangibly demonstrating that utterances are to be
broken down into their component parts.  (Note that neither the
acoustic signal nor the visual signal for deaf children contains
any reliable decompositional markers.)  Second, the presentation
of spoken sentences plus lexigrams amounts to multi-modal
symbolic input for the subject; the signal is presented via
auditory and visual channels simultaneously.  (Perhaps there was
also some tactile input if the bonobo was permitted to touch the
lexigrams.)  This would surely facilitate a multi-modal cognitive
representation.  Recall that humans arrive at amodal
representation even if stimuli are perceived uni-modally.
<P>On our view, the bonobo reported on by Savage-Rumbaugh and
her colleagues has demonstrated considerably advanced abilities.
This was made possible by the unique linguistic environment in
which the primary data were encountered.  We might suggest that,
in fact, this study (and others in which chimps have been exposed
to naturalistic data in this bi-modal situation) can be
interpreted as support for our claims about the central
importance of the abstraction of properties (or distinctive
features) and amodal cognitive representation.  When these
prerequisites for linguistic ability (and language acquisition)
are facilitated for the apes, their incipient language-like
abilities flourish.  Naturally, however, no such facilitating
environment was available for our hominid ancestors.  Instead,
they had the neuroanatomical advantage of connected POT and
Broca's areas.
<P>As we have already mentioned, H. habilis, by virtue of
having no identifiable lunate sulcus, had a POT.  Recall that
there is evidence in the fossil record that she also had a
Broca's area.  Recall, too, that on our view Broca's area does
not directly subserve linguistic capacity.  Instead, it is
involved in the hierarchical organization of cognitive events.
As such, it is crucial to the phonological, morphological, and
syntactic aspects of grammar, and might well be responsible for
the structure dependent aspect of all grammatical levels and
modules.  At each level, linguistic units are comprised of
smaller "building blocks" (at least above the level of phonetic
distinctive features).  For instance, phonological units are made
up of phonetic segments, phrases are built from syntactic-level
words, and words are the result of the combination of roots and
affixes.  CS, too, is made up of component ontological categories
organized into larger units like STATES and PATHS (as exemplified
in Section 8.1.).
<P>Further, and again by virtue of derivation from motor
cortex, Broca's area would be responsible for temporal sequencing
in the grammatical modules (as well as other aspects of
cognition).  A disruption to the functioning of Broca's area,
therefore, would have ramifications in many identifiable aspects
of linguistic competence and performance.  Temporal and
hierarchical structure are recognizably basic to both phonology
and syntax.  Clearly, temporal and hierarchical ordering
mechanisms are not, in and of themselves, language.  Neither, as
we have discussed, is CS.  Linguistic ability is possible only in
a neurological environment in which the physical modules
underlying these domains (i.e., temporal ordering, hierarchical
structure, CS) are reciprocally interactive.
<P>A conclusive analysis of Broca's area as the regulator of
the temporal and hierarchical structural aspects of language
would require extensive examination of the relevant aphasia data.
If the underlying competence of Broca's area is, in fact, the
superimposition of hierarchical and temporal structure on
representations to which it has access, we would not expect to be
able to define the behavioral characteristics of damage to this
region solely in terms of one or another of the theoretically
autonomous grammatical modules.  Indeed, the recent structural
accounts of Broca's aphasia derived from phonological,
morphological, and/or syntactic theories (e.g., Zurif and
Caramazza, 1976; Kean, 1977, 1980; Berndt and Caramazza, 1980;
Linebarger, Schwartz and Saffran, 1983; LaPointe, 1983, 1985;
Grodzinsky, 1984, 1986) leads us to assume some underlying
commonality.  This assumption is further supported by the recent
work of Greenfield, 1992.  An hypothesized disruption in the
structural encoding of information across levels would indeed
appear to account for reported deficits, linguistic and
otherwise, in Broca's aphasia (further investigation of this
matter is clearly indicated, but beyond the scope of this paper).
<P>For the theory presented here, the POT is taken to underlie
amodal representation, and Broca's area, temporal and
hierarchical structure.  The interaction of these components
yields CS and is prerequisite to, but unlikely to be sufficient
for, language.  It should also be mentioned that nothing here
precludes the development, evolutionarily, of a close association
between Broca's area and aspects of vocal tract control.  There
is undoubtedly a connection between the detailed and precise fine
motor control necessary for speech articulation and the
sophisticated programs of the motor association cortex adjacent
to Broca's area.  The evolution of a modern vocal tract, however,
cannot account for the appearance in the fossil record of
demarcated Broca's area and the POT (contra Lieberman, 1984,
1985, 1989); the anthropological literature suggests that these
areas significantly predate extensive evolutionary changes in
vocal tract morphology (see Arensburg, Schepartz, Tillier,
Vandermeersch and Rak, 1990).
<P>We reiterate here that our account of the emergence of the
POT and Broca's area does not depend on selectional pressures for
strictly linguistic ability in the earliest hominids.
Selectional pressures for improved eye-hand coordination and
manipulatory capacities are clearly established in the fossil and
archaeological records.  Our account relies on the
reappropriation of the expanded, or appended, neural modules
associated with these abilities.  The cognitive products that
were enabled by the aforementioned reappropriation of these
structures, once established, may themselves have been highly
adaptive and available for selection.  It is important to
remember that all known evolutionary forces, whether direct or
indirect, operate on biological systems.  Accounts of selectional
pressures for language subsequent to the reappropriation must be
thusly constrained.
8. The learning theory
<P>Thus far we have argued that it is not unreasonable to
suggest that Homo habilis had CS.  But having CS is not the same
as having language.  In fact, if the theory of grammar that we
are assuming is correct, CS is not itself even a part of the
grammar.  What must be shown is that having CS permits language:
in other words, that it provides a basis for the acquisition of
language.  This is exactly what we propose.
<P>8.1. Conceptual Structure and acquisition
<P>We assume the theory of language acquisition proposed in
Wilkins (1994).  The primary aspect of this theory that is
relevant for our purposes here is that the input to the learner
involves, crucially, a representation of meaning in the form of
CS.  An advantage of assuming that CS forms part of the input to
the learner is that it is not part of grammar and therefore need
not be learned in the course of language acquisition.  In the
assumed acquisition model, input to the language learner includes
CS, but not CS alone.  In each datum for the learner, the CS is
paired with a syntactic structure.
<P>Another important aspect of the assumed learning theory is
that it requires no tutor and no correction from external
sources.  This has consequences for the course of acquisition in
terms of the unavailability of so-called negative evidence.  With
respect to the genesis of language, this is an important point
because, of course, there would be no possible tutor or other
external error-correction mechanism.
<P>The learning model was originally developed to explain how
human first-language learners acquire vocabulary items, verbs in
particular.  It is couched in terms of the learning of linguistic
properties of predicates and how they are syntactically
represented.  For the learning theory, as well as for our
purposes here, we assume the formalism for CS worked out largely
by Jackendoff.  Nothing turns, however, on our adoption of this
particular formalism.  What is important is that CS be made up of
a limited set of primitives (ontological categories) that are
modality-neutral and hierarchically structured (as necessitated
by human neurology, as already discussed).  Jackendoff's notion
of CS is specifically intended to be a representation that is
compatible with a number of cognitive modalities but is itself
modality-neutral.
<P>The lexical entry for put exemplifies a typical (partial)
CS:
<P>put
<P>(i)        [-N, +V]
<P>(ii)      NPi ___ NPj PPk
<P>(iii) [EVENT GO ([THING =A3]j,        [FROM ([PLACE  ]i)] )]
<P>PATH  [TO ([PLACE =A7])]k
<P>(iv) [EVENT CAUSE ([THING =A4]i, [EVENT ACT ([THING  ]=A4, [THIN=
G  ]=A3)])]
The first line of the CS (line iii of the lexical entry)
indicates that put involves the movement of some entity along a
path from one place to another; the second line (iv) indicates
that putting is a causal event in which one entity (purposefully)
acts on another.  The motivation for the two different "tiers"
(Jackendoff's term) follows Culicover and Wilkins (1984, 1986) in
relating the thematic tier to the theory of perception and the
action tier to the theory of events.  Perception and event theory
are assumed to be independent from (but, of course, related to)
language.  (For in-depth discussion of the nature of CS, see
Jackendoff, especially 1983, 1990; Culicover and Wilkins, 1984,
1986; and Wilkins, 1994.)
<P>The nature of perception and event structure account for the
particulars of the two tiers of CS.  And CS corresponds, in ways
that are only partially understood thus far, to aspects of
linguistic structure, such as the subcategorization and argument
structure for particular predicates.  It is this relationship
that must be learned.  But language acquisition does not involve
the learning of CS; for the purposes of the language learner, CS
is given (i.e., innate).
<P>The task for the modern human language learner, according to
our acquisition model, involves determining which parts of CS in
a presented datum correspond to which parts of the syntactic
structure in that datum.  For example, if presented with a datum
including a meaning representation (CS) and a syntactic structure
(SS) such as
<P>CS: [EVENT GO ([BALL],     FROM ([PLACE ([BEN])]) )]
<P>PATH TO ([PLACE ([CALI])])
<P>[EVENT CAUSE ([BEN], [EVENT ACT ([BEN], [BALL])])]
<P>
<P>SS: [S [NPBen] [VP [V'[Vthrew] [NPCali]] [NPthe ball]]]
the learner must discover that it is [CAUSE to GO along a PATH
=46ROM PLACE TO PLACE] in the CS that corresponds to throw, which
is part of the syntactic structure.  In order to even begin to do
this, the learner must be able to analyze both the CS and the SS
into sub-parts.  She must recognize that the input datum is made
up of distinctive parts.  The acquisition task, the learning of
lexicalization patterns, involves associating a constituent of
the CS with a particular syntactic constituent.  Then, of course,
the resulting lexical item must be stored in sufficiently
abstract form (e.g. with variables rather than names) so that it
can be used in novel instances.
<P>On this view of the acquisition of lexical items, no
learning could take place in the absence of the ability to
recognize distinctive parts or to generalize abstract
representations of these parts across situations, even those
related to different sensory modalities.  The same basic CS
representation involving GO along a PATH, evident here in the
verbs put and throw, is relevant, for example, for the verb cool,
meaning GO FROM a higher TO a lower temperature.  The
pervasiveness of such abstract categories as GO, FROM, and TO
across semantic fields in the representation of lexical items has
been amply demonstrated by many linguists (see, especially,
Gruber, 1965, 1967; Jackendoff, 1972, 1990; Talmy, 1975, 1976,
1980).  Lexicalization for human language requires the
recognition of such abstract, distinctive, sub-parts of input
data.  And lexicalization would seem to be an undeniable, basic
component of language acquisition.
<P>8.2. The primary linguistic data for H. habilis
<P>We turn now to the possible acquisition situation for Homo
habilis.  By virtue of having a brain with a POT and a Broca's
area, H. habilis would have possessed structured modality-neutral
representation, hence, CS.  As we have stressed, this in and of
itself does not mean that she had language.  However, the first
step in language acquisition for H. habilis might not have been
so radically different from that for the modern human child.
<P>Even the modern child presumably is not aware a priori that
there is a task to accomplish.  The child simply brings human
cognitive capacities to an environmental context.  As a
consequence of the nature of human cognition, environmental
context is converted, in the mind of the learner, to usable data.
In other words, on our view (and this is an admittedly
controversial issue), language acquisition is accomplishable by
the human child because she can "recruit" the necessary input,
the appropriate triggering data, from the vastly overly rich
surrounding environment.  The data does not come "prepackaged"
for the learner.  For example, the acoustic signal does not come
to the child broken down into, or labelled with, the
linguistically relevant phonological or syntactic units.  Neither
does the environmental context in any simple way reduce down to
the cognitively relevant units of CS.  The usable input data for
the language learner is available in the environment because it
is perceived by a learner with human cognitive capacities.
<P>Admittedly, however, for the modern human child, the complex
environment contains language.  In order to speculate about the
acquisition situation for our habiline ancestors, we must turn
attention to situations in which individuals have matured in
contexts devoid of language.
<P>In order to investigate the extent to which language
capacity is innate, or whether there is a critical period for
language acquisition, numerous researchers have investigated so-
called feral children (for a recent review of this literature,
see Candland, 1993) and children who have been purposefully
deprived of linguistic stimuli (see, e.g. Curtis 1977).  The
consensus on most such studies is that children deprived of
language data do not acquire language, or in other words, that
language acquisition cannot take place in the absence of a
linguistic community.  This cannot be the whole story, however,
because some generation of human children, at some point in our
ancestral history, must have been the first to have language.
<P>We suggest that the failure of modern-day linguistically
deprived children to show evidence of language acquisition is due
not simply to the absence of language in the environment, but
also to the severe psychological and social deprivation that such
children must endure.  The situation might be markedly different
in a context in which a child were linguistically isolated but
raised in an otherwise normal social environment (see overview in
Hewes (1992) of attempts at different points in history to set up
such naturalistic experiments).  To draw a parallel with the
habiline child we would need to investigate a psychologically
healthy infant in a linguistically deprived but otherwise normal
psycho-social situation.  Something very like this was reported
on by Feldman, et al. (1977) for deaf children raised in
linguistic isolation because their parents and other care givers
thought it best not to provide them access to a manual language.
These deaf linguistic isolates underwent an acquisition process
with striking parallels to what might have been plausible for the
first generation of language acquirers.
<P>According to Feldman et al., the children they studied
created manual language; in the absence of language data they
developed symbolic gestures.  Furthermore, they developed
gesture-order rules similar to the word-order rules devised by
hearing children in the early acquisition stages.  Of particular
relevance to our earlier discussion of representation and
structure, these deaf children demonstrated naturally-occurring
segmenting behavior.  The knew that gestural acts could be broken
down into smaller units that for them became signs.  Further, and
importantly for our proposed evolutionary scenario, they
naturally demonstrated the ability to abstract general features
across gestural situations.  For instance, the twisting movement
of the hand (observed in the opening of a jar) came to symbolize
the lexical element jar.  The abstract notion red was expressed
by the pointing out of many red objects.  Both of these examples
illustrate the ability these children had to make referential use
of language via the abstract representation of distinctive
properties of perceptual units.  We suggest that this is the same
ability demonstrated by infants in the metaphorical mapping
experiments, the identification and abstraction of features.
<P>The children studied by Feldman and her colleagues developed
referential signs based on naturally-occurring gestures in their
environment.  Stylized pantomimes became iconic symbols, and
these symbols were subject to ordering rules.  Feldman and her
coauthors point out the similarity between the linguistic systems
developed by these deaf children and novice language use among
hearing individuals (e.g. children and foreigners) including
hierarchically arranged linguistic levels.
<P>In later work, Goldin-Meadow and Mylander (1990) report on
the continuing development of structured language in these deaf
children, including many further examples of the generalization
of abstract features (e.g. the use of handshapes to represent not
only the handgrip around objects but also for the objects
themselves, and then, in combination with motion signs, to mean
the opening or closing of the object).  These children have even
gone so far as to develop a (rudimentary) morphological system,
shown in an ability to "analyze...gestures into component
morphemes" (p. 313).  This development of increasing complexity
in the linguistic system of these children leads us to wonder how
such a linguistic situation might develop were a next generation
of offspring exposed exclusively to the system developed by these
linguistic isolates (see relevant discussion of the creolization
process in Bickerton, 1990).
<P>In their discussion of the deaf children, these researchers
make repeated reference to the motivational need on the part of
the children to develop a communication system.  Nothing in our
discussion thus far has suggested that our habiline ancestors
lacked a communication system, so we would not argue that they
were pushed to create language for strictly communicative needs.
We suggest instead that in the brain/mind of a psychologically
healthy individual with the necessary neuroanatomical structures,
and hence, necessary cognitive capacities, language will be
acquired.  The nature of the linguistic system that develops in
the mind of the individual will, of course, be shaped by the
nature of the environment in which the individual exists.  In an
environment in which some natural language is used, that language
(e.g. English) will be learned.  In the absence of linguistic
primary data, a natural, probably pidgin-like system will
develop.
<P>Returning more specifically to the case of H. habilis, we
must speculate on the situation of linguistic isolates who are
not deaf.  Such individuals would not have been restricted to
recruiting their first symbolic units from the gestural
repertoire.  They had access, too, to a wide range of auditory
"gestures," both of their own making and existing in the external
environment.  As is well known, primates are noisy animals.  They
tend to vocalize as they execute certain behaviors and, further,
certain external stimuli typically evoke particular
vocalizations.  It is not unreasonable to assume that H. habilis
too was a noisy animal, that she had a systematic repertoire of
calls.  It seems not unreasonable also to think that a habiline
child might have recruited from this call repertoire to create a
linguistic sign (just as the deaf children recruited from the
gesture repertoire to create gestural signs).  These acoustic
signals, simply part of the primate call system for the adult
vocalizer, might have taken the form of linguistic signs in the
mind of the child.  This is not meant to indicate that the vocal
call system became language, rather that the calls might have
served as the primary data from which signs were recruited by the
first language acquirers.  The situation was the same for the
deaf children.  Their mothers' natural gestures did not become
language; they simply provided the input from which signs could
be recruited.
<P>A vocal call could serve as input for learning only in the
environment of a brain capable of supporting CS.  In other words,
the status, or usefulness of the call for the purposes of
language acquisition would depend on the cognitive capacity of
the perceiver of the vocalization.  On this view, in the
environment of the appropriate cognitive structure (that is,
supported by a brain with a POT and Broca's area), a vocalization
could be recruited as an input datum for language acquisition.
Then something like the Wilkins (1994) learnability model might
have served for the building of lexical entries consisting of
sounds paired with CS representations.
<P>To recapitulate, we suggest that learning in some fashion
can take place even with highly impoverished input and, in fact,
that primitive language-capable learners could have begun to
construct a lexicon, in a fashion not dissimilar from that
outlined for modern human learners, especially those deprived of
normal linguistic input data, on the basis of CS and
environmental acoustic signals.  It falls outside the scope of
the lexical learning theory to predict how the learner moves from
the acquisition of lexical entries to aspects of the syntactic
component.  It also falls outside the scope of this article to
speculate on how language evolved once the emergent capacity and
CS came into existence.  We think, however, that it is suggestive
that the evidence for hierarchical structure is so pervasive, as
is the importance of distinctive features, both in adult
linguistic systems and in the early stages of acquisition, both
for children in normal circumstances and for the deaf linguistic
isolates.  Given the natural impetus to hierarchical and temporal
ordering that results from Broca's area, syntactic structure
might be inevitable once there are lexical units capable of being
ordered.
<P>We make no substantive claim here, however, about how modern
syntax and phonology, might have evolved (however, of course, the
hierarchical ordering, necessary to these components, would have
been available).  Our specific claim is that the emergent
ability, driven by the evolutionary appearance of CS, was the
capacity to acquire meaningful, symbolic, abstract, units--
lexical items. Once this first step is realized, researchers
might well speculate on how aspects of grammar could have evolved
(see Hurford, 1989; Pinker and Bloom, 1990; Newmeyer, 1991).  In
any discussion of evolution, however, we would take the basic
biological components to be of primary importance; evolution,
after all, functions ultimately at the genetic level, only
subsequently being expressed at the morphological level and later
yet at the level of cognition.  And even though we have argued
against strict adaptation as normally understood as the
appropriate evolutionary mechanism for this all-important first
step, it would be appropriate to expect adaptation-based
explanations to come into play at later stages, once language
came to be used preferentially as the human communicative
system.
9.  Conclusion
<P>As we indicated in the Introduction, it was our intention in
this article to propose a plausible evolutionary account of the
emergence of neurolinguistic preconditions in humans.  In order
to do this, we built upon, and brought together, research from a
number of different disciplines.  Through our attempts here, we
hope to encourage other cognitive scientists to join the
discussion of language origins and, by extension, the evolution
of cognitive capacities.  In order for this discussion to reach
an adequate level of sophistication, the linguist's voice must be
heard.  Only through a true appreciation of the linguistic
capacity can strides be made in explorations of human cognition.
As linguists are all too well aware, even the best and most
sophisticated researchers in allied disciplines underestimate the
difficulties and complexities of language.  Nowhere is this more
evident than in questions of evolution.   We cannot leave the
discussion of language origins to those researchers who have yet
to understand the concerns of modern linguistics.
<P>Throughout our presentation here we have been careful to
separate linguistic capacity from communicative abilities.  This
has been important in our argument because we do not claim that
human language developed from communication-system precursors.
The capacity for language is not equivalent to the ability to
communicate, which does not deny the fact that language is used
as the primary communicative tool for modern humans.  But neither
for modern humans nor for the emergent language-user were
language and communication isomorphic.
<P>The arguments for and against the distinction between
language and communication have been rehearsed at length in the
linguistics literature.  Our reasons for the distinction are
based on what we take to be the most convincing of the
theoretical linguistic arguments, but, for us, these arguments
are further bolstered by the distinct neuroanatomical bases for
these two systems.  Vocalizations in non-human primates, while
complex and surprisingly sophisticated (see Cheney and Seyfarth,
1990), maintain close connection to limbic drives and are only
rarely under strictly volitional control.  Human language, while
requiring some minimal limbic contribution, is largely
neocortically derived and volitionally controlled (Kuypers, 1958;
Robinson, 1972, 1976; J=81rgens, 1976; Ploog, 1988).
<P>Because we distinguish language from communication, we do
not find it remarkable that no convincing linguistic precursors
have been discovered in the communication systems of non-human
primates such as the great apes.  We would expect to find such
precursors only if linguistic preconditions predated the
genealogical separation of hominids from the other primates, or
in other words, if language capability emerged in an ancestor
common to both the pongids and hominids.  Our claim that the
neurolinguistic preconditions were met in H. habilis means that
pongids, no matter how communicatively able, do not possess even
rudimentary language.  A failure to make this language-
communication distinction, and/or a failure to appreciate
phylogenetic relationships, has led researchers to look for
linguistic precursors in the extant non-human primates (as
mentioned in Pinker, 1992).  Implicit in the many studies of
"language" in the great apes (Gardner and Gardner, 1971; Premack,
1976; Rumbaugh, 1977; Patterson, 1978; Terrace, 1979; Shapiro,
1982) seems to have been a view of evolution based on assumptions
with which we have herein pointedly taken issue.
<P>The scenario we have developed here suggests an evolutionary
explanation in terms of reappropriative mechanisms with
specification of the preadaptive status of the neural
substrate(s) used in complex manual manipulation.  The selective
pressures for the manual abilities that we have discussed were
most likely operative as early as the appearance of the pseudo-
opposable thumb, that is, in ancestors of the modern primates.
While we predict a "gap," an apparent qualitative distinction,
between the neocortical capabilities of the extant great apes and
those of humans with respect to language, we would not expect
such a gap in those capabilities related to use of the hand.
Further, we would expect to find a gradational distribution of
cognitive capabilities in the associative integrations of
perceptual information.  In other words, we would expect
increasingly complex and more human-like cognition in those
species most closely related to humans.  And further, we would
predict that more language-like behavior would be demonstrable in
species whose neural organization more closely resembles the
hominid pattern.  Hence, we would not be surprised to find that
the bonobo neuroanatomical configuration more closely
approximates the hominid condition than does the pongid
configuration of the common chimp that we have discussed here.
<P>Regardless of the eventual outcome (if one can ever be
determined) of the debate about the adaptive status of early
language (see Pinker and Bloom, 1990, and commentary thereon),
the reappropriation account as formulated has explanatory force.
Neither unknown pressures for linguistically formatted
communication, nor unspecified adaptive responses specific to the
same, need be invoked in order to account for the evolution of
language-consistent neural structures; such structures are
derivable from known pressures and adaptive responses already
evident in the established fossil record.
