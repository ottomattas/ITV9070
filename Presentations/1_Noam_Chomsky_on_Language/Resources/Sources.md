Here are some sources to consider:
- You may want to listen to some podcasts with Chomsky himself: for example, [this](https://podbay.fm/p/robinsons-podcast/e/1679583620) and [this](https://lexfridman.com/noam-chomsky).
- Certainly read about criticism. You may want to listen to [this episode](https://lexfridman.com/edward-gibson) with a critical analysis of Chomsky.
